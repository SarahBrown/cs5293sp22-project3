SarahBrown	training	Aoki	The is certainly the case with ████.
SarahBrown	training	Al Gore's	"Scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of █████████ documentary ""An inconvenient truth"" but frankly..."
SarahBrown	training	Erica	█████ is even better in this than in Traffic.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	█████████████ should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role.
SarahBrown	training	Melvyn Douglas	██████████████ plays wry amusement to perfection as well, never hitting a single wrong note.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	Every little problem that pops up for the █████████ renovation project--including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'Wham'--seems to bring together everything that *could* go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch.
SarahBrown	training	Leonard Maltin	Well, I have to disagree with ██████████████ on this animated short.
SarahBrown	training	Maurice Richard	 Back in the 1950s, everyone in the Quebec provinces idolized the Montreal Canadians and their star player, ███████████████, and everyone wanted to be like him.
SarahBrown	training	Maltin	Maybe to someone who doesn't follow sports at all, like ██████, this situation seems odd and humorous to him...but it's a fact of life or any bit-time sports fan and his favorite team.
SarahBrown	training	Leonard Maltin's	"This movie was part of the DVD ""████████████████ Animation Favorites From The National Film Board Of Canada."
SarahBrown	training	Will Smith	for a tiny idea, pop like 50 hits of E, watch Death Factory while on the phone with Jesus, wait, Jesus is on call waiting, you're having phone sex with ██████████ on the primary line.
SarahBrown	training	Benny Hill	Back in those days (the 90's) their programming consisted of ██████████ reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host.
SarahBrown	training	Simon Pegg	Forget about ██████████ in Hot Fuzz (for now.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Drebin	████████████ is clueless at most times, a terrible driver, a terrible shot, macho yet sensitive and vulnerable.
SarahBrown	training	Capt Drebin	███████████ (notice he's a Captain here) has perfected it.
SarahBrown	training	Lee-hom	In my opinion, ███████ is the best at playing a straight and realistic character.
SarahBrown	training	Gackt	However, any lack of acting ability on █████'s part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being over-dramatic.
SarahBrown	training	Hyde	I wasn't sure if ████'s character was supposed to be as sulky and sarcastic as he came across, but it doesn't really detract from the movie either way.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Curtiz	Since the talkies are still quite young, the camera work is a little static, but ██████████████ does a good job directing the action.
SarahBrown	training	Powell	██████ played it the most (five times) and is the best fit for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time.
SarahBrown	training	Harry Harrison's	"That question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film, based on ████████████████ 1966 novel ""Make Room!"
SarahBrown	training	Cotten	As it turns out, ██████ was on the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation, the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing.
SarahBrown	training	Edward G. Robinson	"He gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute ""book"" (██████████████████, in his 101st and final cinematic appearance), and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like."
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	The ███████ family was comprised of four people, the father, a minister, who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly.
SarahBrown	training	Brad Pitt	█████████ starred in this film before he was really THE!!
SarahBrown	training	Brad Pitt	█████████, and his acting performance in this film was, to say the least, remarkable!!!..
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	The recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the ███████ brothers, and to a lesser degree, the father!!
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	Breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the ███████ brothers had for life...
SarahBrown	training	Paul	What this film also points out, is that the younger brother, ████, has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman!!
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	The seedier side of life prevails in the younger brother's existence, and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the ███████ family!!
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	As most human shortcomings go, the ███████ family made light of turbulent waters, (literally) and thus, established unity as a family, by putting necessary blinders on!!!
SarahBrown	training	Norman Maclean	For ██████████████, stoicism is a prerequisite to perseverance in his emeritus years!!
SarahBrown	training	Norman	For ██████, his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook, and precarious resolve!
SarahBrown	training	Norman Maclean	██████████████ must come to grips with the fact that his life has been fragmented by misunderstandings!
SarahBrown	training	Norman Maclean	██████████████ has become a decrepit octogenarian who is polarized by virtual conclusions to his life!!
SarahBrown	training	Norman	The people and places which were important in ██████'s life, are now only a bittersweet memory....merely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of Montana's beautiful streams and rivers...
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	"To which, for the entire ███████ family, ""all things merge into one and a river runs through it"""
SarahBrown	training	Michael Curtiz	It moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by ██████████████ (he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along), has a very ingenious story line (including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible) and has a very good cast.
SarahBrown	training	Mary Astor	██████████ isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production.
SarahBrown	training	Frank	█████, the master mind.
SarahBrown	training	Carlos	██████, the weapons expert.
SarahBrown	training	Max	███, the explosives expert.
SarahBrown	training	Frank	Added to the mix is the fact that █████ is gone and they are not sure why they have called together.
SarahBrown	training	Frank	Now █████ is being taken back to New Jersey by the 2 detectives but soon escapes on foot and tries to make his way back to the guys who are having all sorts of problems of their own.
SarahBrown	training	David & Bathsheba	Typically for the genre, █████████████████ is a large, grandiose production.
SarahBrown	training	Leon Shamroy	From its excellent set designs to it's positively gorgeous Technicolor photography {████████████}, it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values.
SarahBrown	training	bush	This is a very humanist picture, in fact lets not beat around the burning ████ here, it's a Biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	█████ nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Although this █████ winning film is fairly well crafted, it is lacking in substance and has many implausibilities.
SarahBrown	training	Dick van Dike	 As the series went on it got a bit silly, one episode I remember █████████████ plays his entire family, which was a bit out of the ordinary, but on the Whole 'Diagnosis Murder' was a really good TV show which had numerous good Guest Stars.
SarahBrown	training	Dick	████ who's now in his mid 80's doesn't seem to change a great deal, and looks as if he'll be working till the bitter end.
SarahBrown	training	Ebert	Your local critics or the national critics like █████ are really no different than you or me.
SarahBrown	training	Sharon	██████ stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	I think this film might be a bit too happy in the end; however, it is deeply entrenched in Afro-American culture and discourse to the point that some white spectators may get the feeling of looking into the life of this Afro-American--██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	They both will have to wait until they direct or star in a movie that perpetuates the usual racist and sexist stereotypes to get an █████.
SarahBrown	training	Derek Luke	██████████ is a helluva actor and I wish him best.
SarahBrown	training	Beatles	"How many performers can affect the original ███████ fans (now in their 50's and beyond), get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and impact everyone in between?"
SarahBrown	training	Lennon	I agree that ██████'s murder was horrible, but only now did I realize that Paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath.
SarahBrown	training	Heather	I was very happy that he's found love again in ███████.
SarahBrown	training	John Lennon	When people remember ███████████, they will first remember his murder and then his music.
SarahBrown	training	Paul McCartney	I now have a new appreciation for ██████████████, because, if nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first.
SarahBrown	training	McCartney	And let's hope another lunatic won't change this, because the █████████ catalog is pretty good.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' █████ is little more that a hood ornament for good party members.
SarahBrown	training	Schindler	Don't get me wrong, █████████ was a classic.
SarahBrown	training	Wayne Alexander's	"The lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is █████████████████ ""Vern"" character)."
SarahBrown	training	David Zucker	This is the only ████████████ movie that does not spoof anything the first of its kind.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Ebert	Dont listen to the critics especially ███████████ he does not know solid entertainment just look at his reviews.
SarahBrown	training	Reece	The acting was great especially from █████ Witherspoon(who was so cute and lovable), and everyone else.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	People have skulls thicker than ███'s helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary.
SarahBrown	training	Ganghis Kahn	I don't think ████████████ has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	What kind of man █████████ actually was is a matter of debate, and quite passionate it seems.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians, █████████ has become a legend.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	█████████ has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of Australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	So not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical █████ gang, I actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie.
SarahBrown	training	Lighthorseman	It was sentimental and romantic, but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow Australians, watch 'The █████████████' and you will see what I mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly).
SarahBrown	training	Ned	Ironically, I actually enjoyed the movie because of that, because it would be those details that most of the focus on ███'s story would dwell.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	This movie was always going to have a hard time, having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to Australians; perhaps a little of ███'s spirit is in this movie, because I think it rebelled against people's expectations, and unfortunately missed both targets.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	For me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ███, and that is why I liked it.
SarahBrown	training	Orlando Bloom's	███████████████ performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something.
SarahBrown	training	P.J. Soles	"It's amazing that actress ██████████ didn't become a big star after playing Riff Randall, #1 fan of the punk rock group the Ramones, in ""Rock 'n' Roll High School""."
SarahBrown	training	Paul McCartney	"One Ramones song, ""I Want You Around"", is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good, particularly a rare ██████████████ ballad heard near the beginning (""Did We Meet Somewhere Before?"")."
SarahBrown	training	Jean Eustache	For direction, cineaste █████████████ drew from the simplicity of early-century cinema; for story, Eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life.
SarahBrown	training	Anne Shirley	"But the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named ████████████ (Dawn Evelyn Paris-a veteran of Disney's series of ""Alice"" shorts who later would adopt her character's name)."
SarahBrown	training	Lucy Maude Montgomery's	 Anne was only 11 in ███████████████████████ source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	The movie suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of ████'s reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven-year-old that from a teenager.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	As in the book, ████ is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her build, her freckles, and her long red hair.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	Being a child of imagination, however, ████ takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	"In fact ████ is the original ""Teenage Drama Queen"" and the film's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character."
SarahBrown	training	Anne Shirley	The actress ████████████ was one of Hollywood's all- time beauties and the film is in black and white.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	"████ regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like: ""If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me""."
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	███████████ is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	You don't need to be affluent with ███████████ to relate to all the Misery hamlet has to go through.
SarahBrown	training	Robert De Niro	██████████████ is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	But once again, the story by ███████████, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply outstanding.
SarahBrown	training	Melville	 I thought I was going to watch a boring teen-flick, BUT in fact the plot is interesting and well executed, the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from ████████ who really shows his talent in this movie, and the fight scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done .
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	" Yes, the movie is very much like ""Bend it like ███████"", but I actually think this movie pulls it off better."
SarahBrown	training	Jeff Corey	██████████ and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men.
SarahBrown	training	Superman	In my opinion, ████████ and the Mole Men is a very intelligent, well-written and well-acted movie.
SarahBrown	training	Superman	Even though we only get to see ████████ fly once briefly, It still makes a great Superman adventure.
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	"████████████ certainly has not lost any of her charisma and ""touch"" since ""Basic instinct""."
SarahBrown	training	Catherine Tramell	London is the city where █████████████████ has moved since the events in BI1.
SarahBrown	training	Catherine	"She is ""screwing your brain"" as █████████ with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain."
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	I also think BI2 would have been better had ████████████ been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	"███ is not just a fan but a ""fanatic"" who travels to Fort Meyers, Florida each winter for the Red Sox Spring Training games and never misses a home game during the regular season."
SarahBrown	training	Phil	"It takes his relationship being on the verge of dissolving, for him to stop and think about his priorities, especially when a pint-size Dr. ████ wannabe asks him, ""You love the Red Sox, but have they ever loved you back?"""
SarahBrown	training	Ryan O'Neal	But I can't say much for ███████████ as Philip, because he is, at best, nondescript.
SarahBrown	training	Donald Trump's	"Briefly, ""The Apprentice"" involves 16 job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity: a position in real estate magnate ██████████████ investment company."
SarahBrown	training	Kristi Frank	████████████ may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly.
SarahBrown	training	Proust	"And what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with, which is directly inspired by ██████'s ""A la Recherche du temps perdu""."
SarahBrown	training	Gilberte	"The first woman's name is always Gilberte, and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of ████████ : Veronika is like a ""whore Gilberte"", beautiful like the night, whereas Gilberte was pure, and ""beautiful like the day""."
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	Veronika takes the place of Gilberte, in █████████'s life and in the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	"For instance, when Veronika notices the strange way █████████ makes is bed, he answers that he saw it in a movie, and then, that a movie, ""it's made for that, to learn how to live, how to make a bed""."
SarahBrown	training	Alexander	█████████ wants to live like he was in a film, he wants his life to be art.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	"""La Maman et la putain"" fights against a conception of art ""principaly political"" - see for example the ironical review of a political movie by █████████."
SarahBrown	training	Proust	"Like ██████ says : ""Art doesn't care for all this proclamations, and only exists in silence."""
SarahBrown	training	Proust	"██████ writes : ""I discover the illusion of realism, which is a lie""."
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	But, █████████ failed where Eustache succeed.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	You can see it in the face of █████████, who looks more and more like a living-dead.
SarahBrown	training	Alexander	The end of the movie shows the symbolic death of █████████, who is smashes by the heaviness of reality.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	And that's exactly █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Bresson	"He claims for instance that he ""loves a woman for parallel reasons, because she played in a ███████'s for example""."
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	This thought is indeed by Eustache, who committed suicide, even if it's said by █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	By fallowing Veronika at the end of the movie, █████████ is condemned to illusions.
SarahBrown	training	Artimisia	█████████ was on late last night.
SarahBrown	training	Artimisia	At first I didn't think I would like it, but seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young █████████, a virgin, pure and passionate.
SarahBrown	training	Tassi	Her romance with the older █████ envoked recognisable feelings.
SarahBrown	training	Willie Clark	His performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Benjamin	Kudos to ████████████████, who played straight man to Matthau.
SarahBrown	training	Woody Allen	I had no interest in seeing the remake with ███████████, because in no way can it match the original.
SarahBrown	training	Alfred Molina	I did have a little trouble with the █████████████ character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen.
SarahBrown	training	David Morse	Of course I love everything ███████████ does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were more good things about this film then that.
SarahBrown	training	Andy MacDowell	Yes, I thought ██████████████ was great.
SarahBrown	training	Heath Ledger	One of my favourite films from the late legend ████████████, who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in.
SarahBrown	training	Shemp	█████ is in top form in the famous in-the-dark scene.
SarahBrown	training	Shemp	"Before it's over, █████'s ""trusty little shovel"" is employed to great effect."
SarahBrown	training	Christine McIntire	Of the elements that make this the best at this point, I have to say #1 is ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Shemp	█████'s scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent.
SarahBrown	training	Dooley	Realizing that all the Dog vs. Man battle of wills scenarios had probably been used up in the first movie, this one turns slightly more psychological in its approach as it concentrates on a criminal with a fixation with Dooley's recently deceased wife after she rejected his book, and blames ██████ for her death.
SarahBrown	training	Belushi	An easy, light going movie, which, while maybe not worth a purchase unless you are a true fan of either the first movie or ███████, definately worth a watch when it comes on TV.
SarahBrown	training	Merle Haggard	"The hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by roller-skates, and in the words of █████████████, ""a joint was a bad place to be""."
SarahBrown	training	Lucille Ball	As ████████████, Rachel York does a commendable job.
SarahBrown	training	Lucy	Even though her comedic-timing is different than ████'s, she is still believable.
SarahBrown	training	Ricardo	Also, though I figure this was due to budgetary constraints, the ███████'s are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in New York, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953.
SarahBrown	training	Lucy	 There's also Desi talking about buying RKO in 1953, during ████'s red-scare incident, even though RKO did not hit the market until 1957.
SarahBrown	training	Asher	"These changes well could have been for dramatic license, and the film does work at conveying the main facts, but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to Oppenheimer and █████, two vital figures in ""I Love Lucy"" history?"
SarahBrown	training	Lucy	The film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about ████'s life, since much is skimmed over or omitted at all.
SarahBrown	training	Sheryl Lee	But they just slap ██████████ around way too much.
SarahBrown	training	Natasha Wagner	In this movie, ██████████████ is a more fully-realized character, and the main bad guy is a gal!
SarahBrown	training	Arly Jover	██████████ (who played a sidekick vamp in BLADE) is very otherworldly and deadly.
SarahBrown	training	Jon Bon Jovi	████████████...
SarahBrown	training	Glenda Jackson	Because users here who do a search on two-time Academy Award winner ██████████████ can find 'The Return of The Soldier' among her credits.
SarahBrown	training	Michael	And there is ███████ , The stupidest guy on whole group , probably stupidest in town and his a cop!
SarahBrown	training	Hyde	He is so stupid that i remember follows: ████ says: Did u called cops ?
SarahBrown	training	Michael	No ███████ comes in and says.
SarahBrown	training	Eric Who's	Then is ██████████ son of grumpy war veteran and son of Kitty the housewife.
SarahBrown	training	Donna	But he loves █████ , his girlfriend with who they plan for they're marriage.
SarahBrown	training	Donna	█████ is one hot girl.
SarahBrown	training	Hyde	ah ████ lives in a basement .
SarahBrown	training	Bette Midler	A longtime fan of ████████████, I must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites.
SarahBrown	training	Bette	█████ thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads.
SarahBrown	training	Bette	"A literal rainbow of emotion and talent, █████ shows us her best from her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the ""Bette of Roses"" album."
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	OK the kid that plays ██████ is a bit toooooo sweet!
SarahBrown	training	Fagan	It is a masterful █████, never leaving his character to do a song.
SarahBrown	training	Bill Sykes	██████████.... when you read the book hes a mean one, and so he is in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver Reed	███████████ was masterful.
SarahBrown	training	Hong Sang	█████████ Soo has also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their lives.
SarahBrown	training	Candy	The unobservant (and uninformed) watcher always saw █████ as a broad actor - a big buffoon.
SarahBrown	training	Caddyshack	"One can watch ""Going Berserk"" over and over (I know I have) with the frequency of ""██████████."""
SarahBrown	training	Candy	Definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed SCTV or █████'s other work.
SarahBrown	training	Rabin	A love story with █████'s assassination in the background.
SarahBrown	training	Emannuelle Devos	████████████████ gives a truly stunning , multi-faceted performance, at times devious and manipulative, at other times open and vulnerable.
SarahBrown	training	Rebecca West	The book by ████████████ was written in 1918, soon after WWI, when shell shock and trauma-induced amnesia were not clichés, as the reviewers call it many books and movies later.
SarahBrown	training	Margaret	"████████ says, ""We quarreled, and as you rowed away, you turned your face away from me."""
SarahBrown	training	Margaret	So we know that the breakup was something that he instigated, that it brought him shame, but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ann-Margaret	I didn't even recognize ████████████ at first and feel that her performance has been underrated.
SarahBrown	training	Jenny	Also, █████ is shown as living in the house in a subservient role, as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time.
SarahBrown	training	Margaret	Having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover (non-sexualin keeping with the mores of the time) from 50 years ago, I couldrelate to ████████'s and her husband's dilemma.
SarahBrown	training	Margaret	My husband, like ████████'s was very understanding, but the strain was very real.
SarahBrown	training	Chris	I thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in █████'s mind.
SarahBrown	training	Dalloway	"In contrast, the actiona of the soldier in ""Mrs. ████████"" seems overwrought."
SarahBrown	training	Chris	Showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to █████ underlines what a major problem the whole group faced.
SarahBrown	training	Villaronga	For this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and Director ██████████ is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense.
SarahBrown	training	Grady Harp	██████████
SarahBrown	training	Laurence Fishburne	The movie did show at least that ██████████████████ can act when he wants to.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	██████████████ is so innocent and yet he was abused such just because he was not white.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	██████████████ has been married to the same women for ten years and he never fooled around with women, coke, cigars, weed, alcohol, or any of those things that are very popular in the places he was growing up.
SarahBrown	training	Wallace	███████ loves his pyro power and uses it for amusement.
SarahBrown	training	Wilder	Vida's house arrest sees its end, but ██████ is preoccupied.
SarahBrown	training	Drew Barrymore	 Some great fireball throwing in this flick...eat your heart out, ██████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Wilder	The film also has some really weird, yet funny elements, like ██████'s fire unit sings songs acapella during firefights and after wards.
SarahBrown	training	Jim Varney	██████████ (globally known as 'Ernest') pops in as Wallace's redneck carnival buddy.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Pierre Leaud	█████████████████ is amazing (more than usual) and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Eustache	█████████████ is no more on this earth, we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors.
SarahBrown	training	Tiny Tim	I love the Christmas special too with Tweety as ████████, it's cute.
SarahBrown	training	Porky Pig	When I was little it was Bugs of course, and █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Pepe	████ is cool, I always loved him.
SarahBrown	training	Preston Waters	██████████████, a 11 years old boy,has problems with his parents and brothers specially because of money issues.
SarahBrown	training	Preston	███████ is a clever boy and decides to have a high price on that check: 1 million dollars!
SarahBrown	training	Preston	All that money gives ███████ things that he always wished for, like a mansion with pool,lots of toys, and even a limousine!
SarahBrown	training	Charles Boyer	A film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war, when a Spanish Republican, sent by his soon to be overthrown government, (█████████████) infiltrates himself into England looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in Spain.
SarahBrown	training	Rusty	The movie has two questions that █████ must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and Is less really more if you are happy?
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	The movie follows a dog named ███████ who had escaped from the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but ends up coming back to earth.
SarahBrown	training	James Newton Howard	███████████████████ enhances the quality of any film he composes for tenfold.
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	I thought that ████ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies.
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	I find it surprising that ████ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted.
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	To me it seemed like ████ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie.
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	but I think it is slightly less good than than ████ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ████ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole.
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because ███████████ was revealed I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely.
SarahBrown	training	Bobba Fett	First off, WHO CARES if ██████████ died???
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	If ████████████ wanted him to die then he wanted him to die.
SarahBrown	training	Bobba Fett's	You had to go to the credits to find out ████████████ name!!!
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	Judging ████ because a minor character died is a bit much I think...
SarahBrown	training	Yoda	Secondly, many fans did not like ████ dying.
SarahBrown	training	Yoda	Another aspect to this point about people not liking ████'s death..
SarahBrown	training	Wan	(Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy) Why was Obi ███'s death
SarahBrown	training	Yoda	but ████'s not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm....
SarahBrown	training	Chewbacca	How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, █████████, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!!
SarahBrown	training	Lando	Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping █████'s base.
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	is that people did not like ███████████ being revealed!
SarahBrown	training	Luke	too if I were ████'s father...
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ████ does not get as many accolades as it deserves.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	"Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as ""just another sequel"") to trash the movie such as ""This movie stinks because ████ is not in it!"""
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ████ suffered unfortunately.
SarahBrown	training	Vipul Shah	While ██████████ had the conviction to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in AANKHEN, he just fails to induce life in the entire packaging of WAQT that is based on something as conceivable as a father-son relationship.
SarahBrown	training	Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu	Adopted from a Gujarati play ████████████████████████, WAQT does have a sensible storyline with a social message to back up.
SarahBrown	training	Aditya	██████ dreams to turning into a superstar but does nothing to make his dreams come true.
SarahBrown	training	Aditya	Ishwar hopes that marriage will make ██████ a more responsible man but he is disappointed.
SarahBrown	training	Aditya	██████ is still at his blithe best leading a carefree life.
SarahBrown	training	Aditya	The endurance limit finally collapses when Ishwar expels ██████ from his house.
SarahBrown	training	Aditya	The sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his now expecting wife baffles ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Vipul Shah's	Add to it director ████████████ easy handling of the screenplay.
SarahBrown	training	Shah	However ████ excels in the effortless handling of emotions for most part of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Akshay Kumar's	However ██████████████ taandav dance is simply ridiculous.
SarahBrown	training	Anu Malik's	███████████ music is fine though unnecessary in the proceedings.
SarahBrown	training	Santosh Thundiiayil's	█████████████████████ camera-work is competent enough though not much demanding.
SarahBrown	training	Rajpal Yadav	While ████████████ has been going overboard with his comic histrionics in many films off lately, this time he underplays his character and is completely restrained.
SarahBrown	training	Boman	His deadpan expressions are perfectly complimented with █████'s over-the-top histrionics.
SarahBrown	training	Shefali Shah	████████████ is convincing in the mother's role.
SarahBrown	training	Akshay	██████ is especially expressive in the scene where his doting father intentionally berates him to make him aware of his responsibilities.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid Kapoor	I am far from a fan of █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	MPKDH	The director's last movie (█████ was complete stupidity.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid Kapoor	█████████████ surprised me with a good performance.
SarahBrown	training	Amrita Rao	The best is easily ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Mujhe Haq Hai	█████████████ and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are nice ballads.
SarahBrown	training	Abhi Aada Adhura Hai	Milan ████████████████████ is also nice in watching.
SarahBrown	training	Hamari Shaadi Mein	The exception is ██████████████████ which is bound to remind you of HSSH and HAHK.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	Especially the scene when ████'s dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	This movie is about a young girl named ████ who gets ill.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	Her father is mad and blind (because she draw s*** on his head to mark him as 'invalid') and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill ████ and his friend.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	They manage to escape and to kill her father and ████ can finally wake up.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	Than ████ finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	They tell ████ that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	████ draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	How does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to ████ as he is supposed to be dead?
SarahBrown	training	Anna	Things I liked were the scene with the photograph of ████'s dad which was the first real scary and horror scene.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	He was even better than ████.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	I also liked how ████ tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier's	████████████████ Europa is a worthy echo of The Third Man, about an American coming to post-World War II Europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery.
SarahBrown	training	Leopold	The colonel soon enlists, or forces, ███████ to be a spy (without giving him a choice or chance to think about it) to see if the Werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains.
SarahBrown	training	Leopold	Soon, ███████ is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir-ish way, where everyone and everything is not what it seems.
SarahBrown	training	Leopold	Its amazing to watch the naive ███████ deal with everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, annoying passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even the railway company's officials who come to examine his work ethic) before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control.
SarahBrown	training	Max von Sydow's	Add ███████████████ hypnotic narration, and Europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world.
SarahBrown	training	Heath Leger	I thought that this film was very well made, ███████████ was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	Maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and I did find it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for █████████ NOT to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought?
SarahBrown	training	Bakjwi	 There aren't many negatives I can say about ██████.
SarahBrown	training	George Hilton	For fans of these crazed Italian thrillers, they will appreciate █████████████ and the turns his character takes and what he's put through.
SarahBrown	training	Sergio Martino	The only thing lacking in keeping this from being a great ██████████████ directed giallo is that the story doesn't have that extra sexual or psychological, or both element to put it over the top.
SarahBrown	training	Kate	My wife, ████ and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!).
SarahBrown	training	Heisenberg	You have to apply ██████████'s uncertainty principle (along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty) not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way.
SarahBrown	training	Vera	The brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when ████ is dancing in a white dress.
SarahBrown	training	Caligari	"The stage sets, costumes & colours are otherwise dazzling & delightfully creepy--sort of in a ""Cabinet of Dr. ████████"" vein."
SarahBrown	training	LUISE RAINER's	But now I have finally discovered the priceless gifts of ██████████████ splendid talents.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	She amply deserved her █████.
SarahBrown	training	PEARL BUCK's	But I dare a million score of newer films to tell ████████████ story with such poignancy, power, conviction and grace.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Sinatra	Even though I'm not a big █████████████ fan, I think he was very good in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Hackman	The whole thing comes together when ███████ decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down.
SarahBrown	training	JFK	Just think ███ and all the people associated in any way with his assassination, who's lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you'll appreciate what is implied in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Jim Maars	"Though the EXACT story line my not have been followed (hindsight here after reading █████████ ""Crossfire"") but it's what is implied that is of interest."
SarahBrown	training	RAMO	I love the music performances, the breakdancing makes me wanna spin, ████ makes me wanna throw a piece...
SarahBrown	training	Anna Madden	11-year old ███████████ draws a house, and visits it in her dreams.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	 While this is going on, ████ is getting increasingly more ill with a fever, and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing.
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte Burke	It's well done, and acting-- especially ███████████████ as Anna-- is top notch.
SarahBrown	training	Burke	█████, who has never before or since appeared in a film, is a real gem.
SarahBrown	training	Tony Arzenta	████████████, a Sicilian hit-man or professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers do not agree.
SarahBrown	training	Hollywoodian	"""Arzenta"" is an unpretentious ,yet very likable filmmuch better than the current ████████████ trash that gets the same label."
SarahBrown	training	Tony	In ████ Arzenta/ Big Guns/
SarahBrown	training	Erika Blanc	No Way Out the very appealing ███████████ (31 years in '73) appears as an unnamed hooker.
SarahBrown	training	Duccio Tessari	██████████████ directed films like Kiss Kiss...
SarahBrown	training	Deanna(Erika Christensen	The movie focus' on two opposite characters., Alecia(Busy Phillips) and ████████████████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Alecia	██████ is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting.
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	██████ is a popular girl and the only surviving victim.
SarahBrown	training	Alecia	Meanwhile the police are investigating ██████ as she might have known the shooting was going to happen.
SarahBrown	training	Jonathan Speelman	Despite the use of █████████████████ as consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	It would require the beauty and eloquence of ███████████ to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh	Making a four-hour-long movie and keeping it interesting is no small undertaking, but ███████████████ pulls it off with flying colours.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh	The cast is excellent with ███████████████ himself as the tormented prince giving a strong and memorable performance.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespearean	He manages to convey his feelings admirably through his voice and one does not have to be an expert on █████████████ verse to catch the myriad of emotions that are waging inside him.
SarahBrown	training	Kate Winslet	████████████ was a positive surprise, I must say.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	I've always liked her well enough as an actor, but wasn't sure she could pull off playing ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ophelia	She is the best ███████ I have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Crystal	I liked the fact that Branagh used some internationally more famous stars to play in some of the minor roles; I especially enjoyed the sparring between Hamlet and the gravedigger played by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Doyle	The music by █████████████ is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Branagh	My hat's off to you Mr. ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Amrita	This upsets ██████ because she just wants her aunt to love her.
SarahBrown	training	Amrita	This movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that ██████ had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn't a rich business tycoons daughter or anything.
SarahBrown	training	sci fi movie	I have to say, from the beginning, when i watched the Stargate movie movie i wasn't blown away or anything it was like an average ████████████, with a lot of POTENTIAL, though the movie wasn't as, erm, amazing as other sci fi movies such as Star wars or aliens, which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing, even though i'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people, i don't remember one line from either of those movies, i'm not a big fan of wearing star wars T shirts, in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you, ah getting slightly off the point here, well my point is that the that you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end, in 2006.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	It features outcast ███████, a fellow canine criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead.
SarahBrown	training	Claudia Black	I would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if █████████████ had not continued on in it!
SarahBrown	training	Vela	Her inclusion as the silly '████' has brought the series down in my estimation.
SarahBrown	training	Ben Browder	To bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ███████████ to replace RDA was a mistake.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	Unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of '████' and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of 'Farscape'.
SarahBrown	training	James Stewart	Margaret Sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and █████████████ always brought out the best in each other.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Morgan's	"This movie sports what I think is ██████████████ most winning performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot."
SarahBrown	training	Ernst Lubitsch	"Director ██████████████ might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph."
SarahBrown	training	Gundam	If you are uninitiated to the ██████ world, this is a good place to start.
SarahBrown	training	Al	By the end, little ██ learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice.
SarahBrown	training	David Beckham	"And if like me, you go to this movie not knowing the definition of ""bend"" in football...don't worry, the movie explains it (I'd also never heard of █████████████ prior to this movie)."
SarahBrown	training	Keira Knightley	"And we all know that ███████████████ hit it big: a few months after ""BILB"" came out in the States, she starred in the equally cool ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl""."
SarahBrown	training	Russell	They spend most of the movie being scared of ███████, and the rest of it running for their lives.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	███████'s performance here is one of the best he's ever given.
SarahBrown	training	Jason Scott Lee	"███████████████ is brutish as a ""superior"" genetic soldier."
SarahBrown	training	David Webb Peoples	This is an underrated, and excellent sci-fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of Blade Runner--██████████████████ wrote both screenplays.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Spielberg	Genteel, softly spoken drama from ████████████████ was his first real venture into this genre.
SarahBrown	training	Schindler	"A departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for his 1993 success, ""█████████'s List""."
SarahBrown	training	Menno Meyjes'	While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the fault of continuity and █████████████ scrambling screenplay.
SarahBrown	training	Walker	This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss ██████'s novel.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	A real shame that maestro █████████ was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director.
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	Performances are strong throughout, with ███████████████ making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved.
SarahBrown	training	Danny Glover	"████████████ lends solid support, though his ""Moses"" was a superior turn for him in ""Places in the Heart""."
SarahBrown	training	William Powell	██████████████ exhibits true star quality.
SarahBrown	training	Nick Charles	Who knows--perhaps he was rehearsing for his future as ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Eugene Pallette	One also can see why ███████████████ made more than 200 films.
SarahBrown	training	Powell	He is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with ██████ is fun to watch.
SarahBrown	training	Mary Astor	██████████ does above average work in a not very meaty role.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Curtiz	I suspect ██████████████ had a ball directing his one.
SarahBrown	training	Red Dwarf	Which was a great shame, as this had the potential to become a great series, although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of long running BBC sci-fi comedy █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Smith	█████████████████ has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Udit Narayan	The actors, the beautiful settings, locations, and surroundings, the deep emotions portrayed, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of ████████████, my favorite) -- everything was just lovely.
SarahBrown	training	Alok Nath	█████████ is such a terrific actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost steals the show from the young stars.
SarahBrown	training	Philip Ahn	The quote I used for my summary occurs about halfway through THE GOOD EARTH, as a captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by ██████████) apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot MORE of the looters among them, as his unit has just been called back to the front lines.
SarahBrown	training	Wang Lung	"My parting thought is in the form of another classic quote, from O-Lan herself (while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband █████████ had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut): ""Meat is meat."""
SarahBrown	training	simon rex	█████████ is the best actor on the show.
SarahBrown	training	Bunny	"Lot 3 doubled for India, and █████'s U-turn Bunny Comes Home gives back to Beery an authentic slice of his past, something he had wanted to believe was true then, the future we spin into again is fantastical now on a grander scale, a newly designed Navy LTA with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance plane how expensive, blissfully optimistic still, ""You got to believe in it, that's the way you make things come true"""
SarahBrown	training	Graham Greene	█████████████ is one of my favorite writers of the last century.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Boyer	█████████████ does not, it's true, come across as Spanish.
SarahBrown	training	Lauren Bacall	█████████████ is appealing as the British girl who falls for him.
SarahBrown	training	Katina Paxinou	But the supporting players are the best: ██████████████ is excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Wanda Hendrix	And █████████████ could break the hardest heart.
SarahBrown	training	Swallow Kittens	Even the one time Villains manage to overflow with A Unique sense, From the Bee Man to the Guy who can ███████████████, they never seem to let me down.
SarahBrown	training	Comedy	And the Deaths that would Normally lead to a Depressing Moment often end up being Purely Comical (Such as an Exploding Scratch & Sniff book) Even with the large amount of Crime shows we have now a days, Daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest, Being not just a Mystery but a love story, ██████ and a Fairy Tale with a hint of Drama all baked into one Wonderful pie.....err show.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	It seems as though ███ has Touched ABC again and forever killed it for me.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	███████ melts into this character so well, that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	Without question this 1984 version of ███████' classic tale is the best ever made.
SarahBrown	training	Hound	And yes, the █████ has seen the 1951 version which was also good, but not good enough.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	█████ is properly gruff as Scrooge.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	But hey, this is ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Clive Donner's	19th Century London comes to life in ██████████████ visionary style.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (█████████████!)
SarahBrown	training	Rock Hudson	falling in love with American pilot (███████████), while trying to get secrets from him.
SarahBrown	training	Andrews	"Also it has ███████ doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--""Whistling in the Dark""."
SarahBrown	training	Lisa Rinna	He and his wife ██████████ would later work on a film about sex addiction.
SarahBrown	training	Jim	But then a mysterious admirer sets her eyes on ███.
SarahBrown	training	Jim	Her identity is never revealed, despite an attempt by ███ and even investigators to discover who she is.
SarahBrown	training	Jim	She constantly harasses ███ through phone calls and letters.
SarahBrown	training	Spoiler Alert	█████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	"I personally liked ███████ better in ""tango and cash""""escape from la/new york"" and ""executive decision""."
SarahBrown	training	Jeff Wincott	Not being a fan of the genre I couldn't place ████████████, and had no leads to search from.
SarahBrown	training	Brigitte Nielsen	Only once ████████████████ traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!)
SarahBrown	training	Cop II	for the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills ██████ did I make the positive ID on her.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Verhoeven	This movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90's couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Nuno Westwood	█████████████, in Estoril, Portugal :-)
SarahBrown	training	Rodrigo Ribeiro	███████████████ Portugal
SarahBrown	training	Gene Wilder's	"The other being █████████████ ""The World's Greatest Lover"" which Fox has sat on since the early 80's as well..."
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	"Yet, ""From Justin To █████"" is in nearly every video store in the country."
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	"Maybe those who took the time to bash this will enjoy ""From Justin To █████"", I'm sure that one is watered enough for them to ""get""."
SarahBrown	training	Qawwali	Well, as it was Himesh Reshammiya creation, so I did not expect much but still I liked couple of songs of the movie including the ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay Deol	██████████ was the most impressive, very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs.
SarahBrown	training	Soha Ali Khan	█████████████, she is a doll, a very cute doll I must say.
SarahBrown	training	Shayan Munshi	Apart from these two, █████████████ needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones.
SarahBrown	training	Haines	Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Marion	"They appear in cheap comedies until ██████ is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic star."
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	A must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned █████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Mardi Gras	██████████: Made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but, are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another.
SarahBrown	training	David Redmon	████████████ open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in America for up to 20 dollars.
SarahBrown	training	M. Pitts	████████
SarahBrown	training	Mellisa	But that was nothing until seeing ███████'s tirade after being fired.
SarahBrown	training	Mellisa	███████ you are like 40 years old and you still throw temper tantrums?
SarahBrown	training	Mellisa	███████ crying and refusing to do an exit interview, just proves to America what everyone thought, you are a spoiled baby.
SarahBrown	training	WAH WAH	███████ I can't get my way!
SarahBrown	training	Mellisa	███████ is by far the smartest contestant and clearly deserves to win the whole game.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie Chaplin	"Clearly by the ""Sex in the City"" standards, ███████████████ was horribly boring."
SarahBrown	training	Umeki	Buttons and █████ (who both won Oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film.
SarahBrown	training	Taka	████, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for Brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty.
SarahBrown	training	Brando	Her speech when she first meets and speaks with ██████ is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema.
SarahBrown	training	Taka	The dialog between ████ and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the film's end is equally good.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Vonnegut	I have not read the novel, or anything other by █████████████, but I am now intending to start.
SarahBrown	training	Keith Gordon	I am going to go for other movies directed by ████████████, as well as the other two apparently related to this, through the author of the books.
SarahBrown	training	Crosseyed	█████████ may not intend to change anybody's life, but I appreciate the depth and substance.
SarahBrown	training	Crosseyed	█████████ isn't perfect, but smart people made it.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust Another Guarded Review	███████████████████████████████ (originally written June 15, 2007)
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	Turns out, it wasn't Transformers and I had been aware of it way back when as 'that ███████████ movie'.
SarahBrown	training	Gaiman	Well, in short, it's a ██████ fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star.
SarahBrown	training	Gaiman	Rumour has it, ██████ might be something of a writer.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	I mean, with this crowd and the title of ████████, I knew what to expect.
SarahBrown	training	Eragon	It was not even another Lord of the Rings wannabe (ahem, ██████).
SarahBrown	training	Michelle Pfieffer	█████████████████ is not, sadly, one of those.
SarahBrown	training	Rupert Everett	██████████████, though, he was a real jerk.
SarahBrown	training	Ricky Gervais	█████████████ is perfectly cast and shows why.
SarahBrown	training	Robert De Niro	██████████████ seemed to be having too much fun for the most part.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie Cox	And ███████████ (who?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy I ain't never heard of.
SarahBrown	training	Claire Danes	████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Claire Danes	████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Claire Danes	████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Cox	And, yes, she's not as good as she can be when ███ isn't in the scene.
SarahBrown	training	Potter	Best flying ship yet -- sorry ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Neil	████, you devil.
SarahBrown	training	Gaiman	But ██████'s story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	I sincerely hope ████████ doesn't get lost among the tentpoles.
SarahBrown	training	Denzel Washington	In his first directorial effort, first of many I hope, █████████████████ confirms once again, that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul.
SarahBrown	training	John Pilger	This is probably the first ███████████ documentary I've seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he's done.
SarahBrown	training	Pilger	My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that ██████ shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the US and UK governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inaction...but makes no suggestion of how to help.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	The dancing, of course, is top-notch, since ██████████ had more than just a hand in the choreography.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	█████ especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the 'Alter-Ego' dance.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	The number is hardly five minutes long, but it (and █████'s genius) still takes one's breath away, even sixty years down the line.
SarahBrown	training	Rita Hayworth	You can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto COVER GIRL and █████████████--not that she doesn't deserve it.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	(Very few of █████'s co-stars have that honour.)
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	I admit I've only seen about three of ███████████'s plays (Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, & of course Hamlet)
SarahBrown	training	Macbeth	one I liked, the other I found so-so (███████), and Hamlet I just found a masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	The fiancé, █████, dies on the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic.
SarahBrown	training	Martin Scorsese	And that's what ███████████████ spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us, something which can't be told without being seen first-hand.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	I watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I didn't have the best time mainly because I didn't know about █████████ or his story.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	But the way █████████ is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true.
SarahBrown	training	Helen Hunt	██████████ gave such a raw performance.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Weber	████████████ as the serial killer was so shocking!
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	It was █████-worthy.
SarahBrown	training	Marmite	Other people I know can't stand it, it really seems to be like ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Jim Dale	They live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life, everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour, and narrated by ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Britons	As a result, Earth cultures such as those of the Aztecs, Mayans, ███████, the Norse, Mongols, Greeks, and Romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy.
SarahBrown	training	Samantha Carter	███████████████ (Tapping) and Teal'c (Judge) compose the original SG-1 team (a few characters join and/or leave the team in later seasons).
SarahBrown	training	Peter Williams	The original arch-enemy from this race was the System Lord Apophis (██████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh's	Now here comes █████████████████ version, which is breathtaking from start to finish.
SarahBrown	training	JERRY MAGUIRE	It finished #2 on my top ten of 1996(behind THE ENGLISH PATIENT, and ahead of LONE STAR, █████████████, FARGO, SECRETS & LIES,
SarahBrown	training	Olivier	And unlike ███████, who depended mostly on his voice, Branagh uses his entire body to demonstrate the range of emotions that Hamlet goes through, but since he plays him as normal, none of it seems like scenery-chewing.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Lemmon	I didn't even mind ███████████, though I agree he was the weakest member of the cast.
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	The most surprising turn came from ███████████████; I've always found him stiff as a board, but he's quite commanding as the Player King.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Crystal	The other big surprise was █████████████; I thought I'd find him all wrong as the 1st Gravedigger, but he was his usual funny self while being in character.
SarahBrown	training	George Peabody	After all, it has won the ██████████████ award as well as the Humanitas award.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Winfield	█████████████ should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Amos Guttman	Unfortunately, the director ████████████ died from Aids-related illnesses the year after making this film, so we don't know how many more gay-related films we might have had from him.
SarahBrown	training	Hessed Mufla	████████████ (Amazing Grace) contains full frontal male nudity, at least in magazines, which turn into a wishful dream sequence.
SarahBrown	training	Guttman	Either the translations are a little weak, or maybe ███████ kept the conversation sparse on purpose, for a little mystery.
SarahBrown	training	Helen Mirren	████████████ would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Glenister	Praise for ████████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Frank McCarthy	It is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film, whereas `Patton- Lust for Glory', producer ██████████████'s earlier biography of a controversial American general from the Second World War, has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments.
SarahBrown	training	Patton	Scott, of course, portrayed ██████ as aggressive and fiery-tempered, a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race, not just with the enemy.
SarahBrown	training	Peck	████'s MacArthur is of a more reflective, thoughtful bent, comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films.
SarahBrown	training	Peck	In an attempt to show something of MacArthur's gift for inspiring leadership, ████ makes him a fine speaker, but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart.
SarahBrown	training	Atticus Finch	It is as if █████████████ from `To Kill a Mockingbird' had put on a general's uniform.
SarahBrown	training	Peck	Even during the Korean scenes, ████'s MacArthur comes across as more idealistic than his real-life original probably was; we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters.
SarahBrown	training	MacArthur	One theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of General █████████'s father, himself a military hero.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur MacArthur	I would have liked to see what sort of man ████████████████ was, and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model.
SarahBrown	training	Peck	Although I may not have agreed with ████'s interpretation of the main role, there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dickens	A rather morbid tale one might think, but it is classic ███████████████, and also one of the most famous and popular Christmas stories of all time.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	To me this is the definitive version of ███████' timeless story; it's the one I always remember watching in school, and I remember being absolutely terrified by it!
SarahBrown	training	Jacob Marley	The ghost of ████████████, the final scene with the ghost of Christmas present under the bridge, and the ghost of Christmas yet-to-come especially I found very frightening.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	Most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text - that of the ghost of Christmas present showing ███████ the two children hidden under his robe (you'd never get away with a scene like that nowadays!).
SarahBrown	training	Snowman	Perfect holiday season viewing; coupled with copies of It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street and The ███████ and you've got everything you need.
SarahBrown	training	Dennis Hooey	"""I was quite a hand with a slingshot,"" ""The King of all Israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy"" (full marks to ████████████ for delivering that one with a straight face), ""Go and sit with the concubines."""
SarahBrown	training	Henry King's	So it's probably a tribute to ████████████ direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide.
SarahBrown	training	Phillip Dunne's	but King brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in ███████████████ script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum.
SarahBrown	training	David	This is the conflicted █████ on the downhill slope, abandoned by a vengeful God he no longer understands, and the film doesn't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty.
SarahBrown	training	David Zucker	████████████ manages to make us all laugh our heads off again, in a really silly, but many times smart, comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	So true to ███████████ and yet so accessible.
SarahBrown	training	Ed Wood	This is a script that ███████ worked over 10 years on trying to get made.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Zane	In the hands of these filmmakers, the music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any grist from the Hollywood script mill, particularly that stupid boat movie ██████████ last was in ('Watch out!', 'Oh no!'
SarahBrown	training	- J. Cameron	████████████.... ick...)
SarahBrown	training	Zane	I'll take ████'s wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film over empty dialogue any day.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Zane	██████████ heads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Ron Perlman	The design is perfect, the pyramid set exquisite, and ███████████'s beastly performance is simply wonderful.
SarahBrown	training	Ed Wood Jr.	Overall, this is a chaotic, visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of ███████████, auteur and cinenephile.
SarahBrown	training	Iliopulos	A must see for anyone who really loves movies the way that the first rate █████████ and his cast obviously do.
SarahBrown	training	Mum	And worst of all, his ███ made him wear this Maple Leafs sweater out of the house.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	They play off of each other effortlessly while █████ also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	The █████-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch, as is the editing.
SarahBrown	training	Brooks	██████ turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	█████████'s first dramatic film is no let-down.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	What I love about this movie is █████████'s ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book.
SarahBrown	training	Danny Glover	Furthermore, ████████████ was excellent as Mr. And usually, he's just himself throughout most of his movies.
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	But, the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Celie	She is excellent as █████.
SarahBrown	training	Ann Grant Lord	██████████████ is dying.
SarahBrown	training	Ann	███ begins talking about people from her past of whom the daughters are unaware, and they question as to whether these lost acquaintances are real or imagined.
SarahBrown	training	Ann	The story shifts, basically, between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at ███'s life between those years.
SarahBrown	training	Ann	It was in 1953 that ███ met the love of her life and experienced her life's greatest tragedy.
SarahBrown	training	Lila	One of Ann's two best friends from college, ████, is being married.
SarahBrown	training	Lila	He is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with ████ and Buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small New England town.
SarahBrown	training	Ann	In the present time, ███'s daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life realizations and doubts.
SarahBrown	training	Constance	█████████ is working to emotional exhaustion trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	████ spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister.
SarahBrown	training	Collette	████████ is perfect for a part such as this, but I have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays.
SarahBrown	training	Meryl Streep	What is there to say about ████████████ other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance.
SarahBrown	training	Lila	All the other scenes in which Close is ████'s very proper mother, and you get another performance to treasure.
SarahBrown	training	Lila	This scene is repeated fifty years later when ████ comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived.
SarahBrown	training	Ann	The other memorable scene - at least to me - is when Buddy declares his love for ███.
SarahBrown	training	Hugh Dancy	██████████ as Buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings.
SarahBrown	training	Louis Brooks	Despite having someone else's voice dubbed over hers, this remains a stunning tour de force for ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Edith Piaf	The fact that her singing voice is dubbed by the legendary ██████████ helps to mollify us purists about the dubbing deception.
SarahBrown	training	Lulu	████ enters the frame as a pair of legs: we see her inside the car changing into her bathing costume.
SarahBrown	training	Lulu	When ████ considers applying for the title of 'Miss Europe' we know that a happy ending is not going to be sitting at the end of Easy Street.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	But at the center of it all is the magnificent █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	█████████████ is not a name that most average movie buffs may readily know but as soon as you see her you will be mesmerised and you'll want to know more.
SarahBrown	training	Mother Night	Not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as ████████████ does.
SarahBrown	training	Burt	The contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it, such as forcing ████ to wear a chicken suit during the race!
SarahBrown	training	Jim Nabors	██████████ is his (not quite convincing) chief mechanic.
SarahBrown	training	Burt	This is a funny film in which ████ proves that he ain't too proud.
SarahBrown	training	Tara Fitzgerald	What can be said of the compelling performance of ███████████████?
SarahBrown	training	Mrs Graham	She is utterly believable as the injured ██████████, hardened by experience, sharp and strong-willed, yet not immune to the passionate attentions of Mr Markham.
SarahBrown	training	Toby Stephens	Through every mischievous glance and every flare of temper, every flicker of discernment in his eyes and telling facial expression, █████████████ is a master of his character.
SarahBrown	training	Helen	He is the force of passion and hope that will restore █████'s injured spirit.
SarahBrown	training	Graves	██████' Huntingdon is a perfect performance of the unreformable rogue.
SarahBrown	training	Helen	█████'s attempt to save his soul-- after leaving him and taking their child at a time when this was unheard of--is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the worth of every human life and soul, however misguided, however sinful that person may be.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Forget Neo and ██████ and all those half-baked made up modern heroes.
SarahBrown	training	John McClane	For better ( Rocky, Rambo ) or worse ( Die Hard 4 - where ████████████, brace yourselves.... had no beard !! )
SarahBrown	training	Tomer Sisley	"This "" Largo Winch "" movie is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least ████████████ delivered a very promising performance as an action-hero."
SarahBrown	training	Mélanie Thierry	And the only one time where he was weakened is when ███████████████ shaved his beard !
SarahBrown	training	Belmondo	For the first time in France since ████████, can a movie be both well- crafted and rooted in B-genre without blushing over its performance.
SarahBrown	training	Dobermann	"In other words it was "" Le Pacte des Loups "" or "" Dobermann "" ( I like █████████, mind you )..."
SarahBrown	training	Don Bluth	Before Time are the best animated films that █████████ has made!
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	███████ hides the stop watch behind his back and switches it back and he returns to Earth alive with Annabelle screaming You can never come back!
SarahBrown	training	Ann Marie	█████████ sees a couple who she thinks would make great parents for her!
SarahBrown	training	Charlie Ann Marie	█████████████████ and Itchy then go to a horse race where they bet the man's money that a horse will win the race!
SarahBrown	training	Ann Marie	The horse they said would win winds up winning and Charlie, Itchy, and █████████ are payed $1,000 for the bet!
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	███████ sad about this has a dream about going to Hell and the Devil!
SarahBrown	training	Ann Marie	Soon Carface shows up and captures █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	He plans to drown her but ███████ comes to the rescue and calls on King Gator who eats Carface.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	███████'s time is up and he must die again.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	She says yes and tells ███████ she loves him and good-bye!
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	███████ enters Heaven again as it's said All Dogs Go to Heaven!
SarahBrown	training	Don Bluth	Filled with wonderful animation, characters, and story █████████ has proved to us again that he is a good animator!
SarahBrown	training	Little Mermaid	It's too bad this movie was release the same year ██████████████ which is my favorite Disney movie!
SarahBrown	training	her Ricardo Cortez	It was also the last time that someone else was billed above her in the credits, that being her leading man ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Mattox	 ██████ is a wicked woman who has some set ideas about who her son should be marrying.
SarahBrown	training	Swain	█████ provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the piglets before they grow into big old hogs to be butchered.
SarahBrown	training	Mattox	When she returns to Spain and tries to rekindle things, ██████ is even more outraged.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	Cortez in fact braves the Torrent in a row boat trying to rescue █████ from harm's way.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	When they do get together they have a brutally frank discussion, the brutality coming from █████.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	They look very similar to the shots used in 20th Century Fox's The Rains Came that came out in 1939 and that won an █████ for Special Effects.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	█████ rightly won rave reviews for her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures was the norm in silent screen acting, she was remarkably subtle in her role.
SarahBrown	training	Tobias Schneebaum	I saw this film at Amsterdam's International Documentary Film Festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and █████████████████, all of whom are lively and outspoken New Yorkers.
SarahBrown	training	Tobias Schneebaum	Equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship █████████████████ had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	This is essentially a variation on House Of Wax ,in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies ,█████████████.
SarahBrown	training	the Great Rinaldo	this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist ,█████████████████ (John Emery)insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs.
SarahBrown	training	Rinaldi	He deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon ███████ and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer.
SarahBrown	training	Price	The rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on █████ who carries the burden with ease .
SarahBrown	training	gore	Good solid B Movie melodrama , this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece .Shot in black and white it is low on ████ and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
SarahBrown	training	Gina	I especially like the way the characters welcomed ████'s various suitors.
SarahBrown	training	Larry Clark	 If this film had been directed by ███████████, then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place.
SarahBrown	training	Erika Christensen	"The only other movie that I've seen with █████████████████ is ""Swim Fan"" which made me almost not want to watch this film, but she turned in a very good performance herself."
SarahBrown	training	Douglas MacArthur	Since █████████████████ affected more human livesfor the betterthan any other American not elected President, he deserved a better film biography.
SarahBrown	training	Joseph Sargent	"From the very early ""Star Trek"" episode ""The Corbomite Maneuver"" (1966) to the recent HBO films ""Something the Lord Made"" (2OO4) and ""Warm Springs"" (2OO5), director ██████████████ has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film, a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors' performances, and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go."
SarahBrown	training	Joe Sargent	Since ███████████ is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience's reactionsagain, see Warm Springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional.
SarahBrown	training	Midway	"And finally, there is a sort of ""made on the cheap"" feel to the film, as there is to ""██████,"" released about the same time."
SarahBrown	training	Jack Smight	"Both films were relegated to ""television"" directors--Sargent in this case, ███████████ on ""Midway,"" and both have a made-for-TV-look."
SarahBrown	training	Charles Boyer	In the train car on the way into the Sahara she sits opposite a very, very troubled man (█████████████) - our former monk.
SarahBrown	training	Marlene Dietrich	████████████████ gives a nicely done, though restrained, performance here and looks gorgeous.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Boyer	█████████████ - not usually one of my favorites - is actually pretty good in this, I think the part sort of suits him and he looks quite young and handsome too.
SarahBrown	training	Basil Rathbone	██████████████ is fine here, except given very little to do.
SarahBrown	training	Max Steiner	Another great orchestral score by ███████████ helps keep the drama rolling - all in all, a very enjoyable film.
SarahBrown	training	Lex Luthor	To see most of the founders of the Justice League trying to bring down ██████████ is what i've been waiting for.
SarahBrown	training	Lana	It sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on ████.
SarahBrown	training	Ebenezer Scrooge	I'm sure that most people already know the story-the miserly ████████████████ gets a visit from three spirits (the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	███████' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite.
SarahBrown	training	Alastair Sims	While I grew up watching the 1951 version starring █████████████, and I believe that he is the definitive Scrooge, I have been impressed with this version, which was released when I was in high school.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	█████████ once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	Of course the Dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some welcome spotlight on █████████).
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	The story is typical for █████████: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relations with everybody else, but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier's	In this movie we can see how good ███████████ handles film as a technical medium.
SarahBrown	training	Emerson	I like how ███████ who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Palance	OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (████████████?) or small children.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell	████████████ is terrific, but (like The Office) the supporting cast really makes the film work.
SarahBrown	training	Homer	As it was already put, the best version ever of █████'s epic.
SarahBrown	training	Pasolini	The clothing is linen, wool and fur, the settings stony and bare, everything is somewhat rugged and primitive, a bit what you would find in Cacoyannis or ████████ movies, and it makes it all the more authentic.
SarahBrown	training	Homer	Actually, it is amazingly close to the original plot by █████, if not to the text itself.
SarahBrown	training	Ulysses	███████ doesn't appear until the first hour, the start being centered on his son looking after him.
SarahBrown	training	Penelope	He finally comes back to his homeland Ithaca after 20 years, and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Kirk Douglas	"The one by Camerini in 1955 starring ████████████ is a classic sword-and-sandal like ""the 10 Commandments"", but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story."
SarahBrown	training	"Lee ""Roll'em"" Sholem"	The film is polished and expertly made, directed by ████████████████████, best known for directing with both speed and efficiency.
SarahBrown	training	God Bless	Give Blood Today █████████!
SarahBrown	training	john carpenter's	My personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line to the first ████████████████ vampires but i don't care I LOVED IT.
SarahBrown	training	Dracula	i was a little confused with the vampires and how they were able to walk in churches but it was cool how they didn't follow ███████ vampire rules.
SarahBrown	training	Hickock	As this film presents the scene,(while ███████ and Smith drank)
SarahBrown	training	Truman Capote	"With the recent release of the movie ""Capote"" based on █████████████, who was the creator of the documentary ""In Cold Blood"", the American people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film!!"
SarahBrown	training	Capote	It was ██████'s instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the American public's attention!!
SarahBrown	training	Truman Capote	█████████████ does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book, (which was a best seller) and, with this documentary as well...
SarahBrown	training	Richard Brooks	"The director, ██████████████, (""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""Blackboard Jungle"" ""Elmer Gantry"" and ""Key Largo"" to name but a few!!) was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie!!"
SarahBrown	training	Cold Blood	"I recommend to everyone that they see this movie...""In ██████████"" was the focal point to the film ""Capote""!"
SarahBrown	training	Lex Luthor	Through his sophisticated technology, Green Arrow learns that ██████████ is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on.
SarahBrown	training	Clark	After recruiting █████ to help, the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local laboratory.
SarahBrown	training	T'pol	"It stumbles a few times into ""Trek"" convention and cliché--candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style, and I can already foresee snickering references to █████ as ""Seven of Vulcan""--but"
SarahBrown	training	Scott Bakula	████████████ hits the right note as a captain with Kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	█████████████ I found to be an excellent movie.
SarahBrown	training	Logan	If you like █████'s Run you'll like this.
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Stewart's	Its photography is unbelievable, editing it must have been an interesting challenge and █████████████████ voice over is PERFECT.
SarahBrown	training	Mary Woronov	"Portraying a bunch of high school students using the Ramones' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal (████████████, of ""Eating Raoul"" fame), the whole movie is a mile a minute."
SarahBrown	training	Paul Bartel	"A dorky music teacher (███████████, also from ""Eating Raoul""*)?"
SarahBrown	training	Allan Arkush	"Too bad that director ████████████ later degenerated into fare such as ""Caddyshack II""."
SarahBrown	training	Keira Knightly	██████████████ also works well with her co-stars, and this is her best work so far.
SarahBrown	training	Vance	I never understood why the DA had to trail █████ around everywhere, I always thought they were deskbound.
SarahBrown	training	Vance	The best bit is where █████ narrates to us all the sequence of events surrounding the murders - dodgy model sets combine with fantastic roving camera angles to produce a very modern feel, and startling with what has gone before.
SarahBrown	training	Chan	The only problem is as usual the conclusion can't match the overall deductive processes displayed throughout and a somewhat contrived ending is invoked; some ████'s, Moto's and many others of course could only be concluded this way too.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	Bend it like ███████ is a fairly typical coming-of-age movie about a fairly atypical girl.
SarahBrown	training	Jess	"This is Parminder Nagra (""ER"")'s breakout role, playing ████, a teenager in England who is caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (that's soccer to us North Americans)."
SarahBrown	training	Jonathan Rhys-Meyers	They also, unfortunately, both love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by ████████████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	In some spots, Bend It Like ███████ falls into clichés.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like ███████ is the little film that could... and did.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	"I was lucky to see ""██████!"""
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	"Th success of ""██████!"""
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	"The song ""Who Will Buy?"" required hundreds of actors and the British film director truly deserved his █████ for putting it all together in a seamless manner."
SarahBrown	training	Boreham Wood	Other film studios at Elstree, ████████████, Bray, Denham, and Ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years.
SarahBrown	training	Airplane	This is so much more entertaining to me than other, more popular spoofs like ████████!
SarahBrown	training	Cathy Moriarty	██████████████ steals the show in my opinion.
SarahBrown	training	Down Syndrome	This film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Georges	The fantasy scenes in the film highlights the fact that ███████ misery towards his abandonment by his family, and his desire to be treated like a normal person.
SarahBrown	training	Georges	We have been treating them with discrimination and neglect, a fact that is highlighted by the scene where ███████ gives a present to the waitress in the kitchen).
SarahBrown	training	Steve Miller's	"Put on ██████████████ ""Fly Like An Eagle"" or Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side Of The Moon"" and you're ready to go!"
SarahBrown	training	Oldboy	From the director of ██████ comes this slick vampire flick.
SarahBrown	training	Kang-ho Song	████████████ stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly, mysterious virus.
SarahBrown	training	kyun Shin's	Because of his supposedly miraculous survival, he comes into the lives of Ha-███████████ family.
SarahBrown	training	Shin	████ has cancer, and his mother believes that Song can cure it.
SarahBrown	training	Kim	███ is intensely interested in the world of vampirism, and the two become lovers.
SarahBrown	training	Chan-wook Park's	What really should be mentioned is ████████████████ mastery of the medium of cinema.
SarahBrown	training	Kim	OK-vin ███ should become a worldwide star after this film.
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey CLASSIC	Myself and my groovadelic 20-something pals just can't get enough of this awesome ████████████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey	"This would also be the purr-fect type of movie to watch with your cat, or even throw a party based on, like a ""Party Girl"" party, just like the one in the movie that the lovable, huggable, squeezable ████████████ goes to at the end."
SarahBrown	training	Ronald Marie MacDougall	Yours, ███████████████████████ (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
SarahBrown	training	John Cusak's	The weakest link is ████████████ accent.
SarahBrown	training	Martinaud	What keeps us going - or at least what I feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether █████████ has done the dirty deed.
SarahBrown	training	Martinaud	But then we discover that this is the story of █████████'s imperfections and his difficulty in coping.
SarahBrown	training	Gallien	And we realize that ███████ isn't as clever as we are made to think he is.
SarahBrown	training	Sammo Hung's	████████████ 1989 film Pedicab Driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Sammo	"The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and ""humor"" as in █████'s otherwise great Eastern Condors (1987), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with."
SarahBrown	training	Max	"Still I think what Fennie says to ███ (about the future ""bad cooking"") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately."
SarahBrown	training	Sammo	Also some funny scenes are created out of █████'s passion for Ping.
SarahBrown	training	Sammo	Pedicab Driver is among the most incredible Hong Kong action films that I have ever seen and easily among █████'s greatest achievements.
SarahBrown	training	Al Gore	███████ showed us the bleak future of planet Earth by presenting hard facts backed up by documented examples through long yet always interesting monologues.
SarahBrown	training	Al Gore	This is exactly the kind of movie that had to be made, in combination with the one from ███████, in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to meddle with.
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Stewart	The voice-over by ███████████████ is always relaxing and thus very well done although at first it sounded as though I was watching an X-men movie instead!
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	This production of ██████ is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	Yea, though ██████ walks through the valley of the shadow of death, he fears no evil.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	At the bottom is █████, the most wicked of the lot.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	█████ contemplates repenting of his ways not once, but twice, yet declines because he is unwilling to pay the price.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	In the middle is ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Nancy	The best is █████.
SarahBrown	training	Bill Sikes'	Lacking in judgment, she ignores ███████████ violent nature out of her deep need for love.
SarahBrown	training	Bridget Fonda	I wish █████████████ had more scenes in the movie; she was an earnest and appealing character.
SarahBrown	training	Vito	Something that I don't understand: why did the cop and ████ have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge?
SarahBrown	training	John ritter	i didn't think another series would start after I read ███████████ had died, however the 2nd series wasn't amazing the latest series is back to it's old excellent standard.
SarahBrown	training	Masterson	█████████ probably has the hardest role and is just adorable.
SarahBrown	training	Clapton	███████, by his own admission, said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best.
SarahBrown	training	Ginger Baker	████████████ demonstrates why so many drummers today, speak of him as some sort of drumming guru.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Bruce	██████████ just great.
SarahBrown	training	Dan Katzir	██████████ has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.
SarahBrown	training	Dan	Instantly, you are drawn in to ███'s plight, and you can't fail to be deeply moved.
SarahBrown	training	Dan	You can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of ███'s desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable.
SarahBrown	training	Reese Witherspooon's	████████████████████ first movie.
SarahBrown	training	Reese Witherspoon's	After watching this movie you will see why ███████████████████ acting career has been so successful.
SarahBrown	training	Moon	The Man in the ████'s length is just right.
SarahBrown	training	Dani	"Even if the end is tragic, ""The Man in the Moon"" has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of ████, with her innocent and pure love affair with Court."
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	His themes (which deserved an █████ nomination) are so intimate and lyric that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music.
SarahBrown	training	Janos Rukh	Karloff plays Dr. ██████████, creator of a device that can capture light rays through his telescope in the Carpathian Mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe.
SarahBrown	training	Karloff	███████ joins the expedition to prove his theories, but Radium X is a tricky compound - it levels mountains at long range, and cures blindness at short range.
SarahBrown	training	James Whale	And even a touch of ███████████ in a cockney landlady in Paris!
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	Karloff slightly overdoes his performance but ██████ is terrific.
SarahBrown	training	Porky Pig	"Despite what the title may imply, ""Pigs Is Pigs"" does not star █████████."
SarahBrown	training	John Belushi's	"Rather, it features a young swine with an appetite more insatiable than ██████████████ character in ""Animal House""."
SarahBrown	training	Daffy Duck	I would mostly say that this cartoon seemed like a place holder in between the really great cartoons (██████████ debuted three months after this came out).
SarahBrown	training	Wang Lung	█████████ is a humble farmer grateful for the basics of life: to survive off of his land and to be newly wed to Olan, a servant to a rich and powerful family in the village area.
SarahBrown	training	Wang Lung	Despite █████████ and Olan's best efforts to farm the land, raise kids, and build savings and wealth, a famine threatens to wipe out everything they have worked for.
SarahBrown	training	Olan	Although not a looter, ████ gets caught up in a mob looting at a rich man's house.
SarahBrown	training	Wang Lung	The newly found wealth transforms █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Wang Lung	As punishment, nature once again turns the table on █████████ by sending a plague of locust to destroy everything he has.
SarahBrown	training	Wang Lung	Brought to his knees, █████████ enlists the aid of all friends, former friends, workers, and family.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	Unfortunately ████ has been contaminated by the Radium and starts to glow in the dark--and his touch causes instant death.
SarahBrown	training	Nay Sayers	██████████ of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love.
SarahBrown	training	Alan	'████
SarahBrown	training	Cartwright	The end result of the trials and tribulations at the Ponderosa Ranch, as demonstrated in this series, sparked a realization that Americans are now auspiciously enjoying the fruits of the ██████████'s painstaking labor!!
SarahBrown	training	Justin Lane	The Bill character (███████████), who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda, was by far my favorite; he seemed the least one-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD.
SarahBrown	training	Adam Jones	Well done to ██████████ and crew.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Taylor	The film largely focuses on a bullying █████████████ as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to put up with him.
SarahBrown	training	Taylor	██████ is blinded by his hatred of Indians and his naivete that the buffalo herds will never disappear.
SarahBrown	training	Sheri Appleby	But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like, even those that only were in for a few episodes (█████████████ for example).
SarahBrown	training	Jerico	It worked for ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	Both of which entrap you in the world ██████████████ creates for you.
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	"""██████████"" is one of the best films ever."
SarahBrown	training	Norman Jewison	"The direction from ██████████████ (who directed ""Fiddler On The Roof"") is fantastic."
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	"""██████████"" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh."
SarahBrown	training	Houellebecq	Unremittingly bleak and depressing, the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised ███████████'s controversial novel of the same name.
SarahBrown	training	Clive Barker's Undying	I gotta say, ██████████████████████ is by far the best horror game to have ever been made.
SarahBrown	training	Silent Hill	I've played Resident Evil, ███████████ and the Evil Dead and Castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements.
SarahBrown	training	Barker	██████ is good at what he does, which is attach the horror to our world, and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game.
SarahBrown	training	Gary Olsen	clearly they couldn't have carried on after ██████████ died
SarahBrown	training	Nicholson	The alien who is doing a █████████ impression will crack you up!
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the King wants to get the Prince to marry), ██████████ is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	"The story of ""Cinderella"" on its own wouldn't be able to pad out a feature, so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise, the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become ██████████'s true sidekicks."
SarahBrown	training	Emily Watson	Similarly, ████████████ shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage).
SarahBrown	training	Turturro	To reach the tortured chess master (████████) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love.
SarahBrown	training	Watson	██████ does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring.
SarahBrown	training	Luzhin	"Later, as their love affair develops, she subtly likens dancing to chess (██████ has learnt to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with ""bold, brilliant moves"" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover)."
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	Writer/Director ██████████ manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' two years earlier, that you will continue to remember years later.
SarahBrown	training	Burton	As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the Dreamtime, the truth exists on two completely different levels, with ramifications more disastrous than ██████ could ever have imagined.
SarahBrown	training	Weir	On the production side, ████ uses his budget to great effect, progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting, to heavy rain, to good use of sound.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Chamberlain	███████████████████ manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery.
SarahBrown	training	David Gulpilil	██████████████ excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds, wanting to do the right thing, but afraid because he already knows the ending.
SarahBrown	training	David Weir	Put all these things together, and you have a perfect example of why ██████████ is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on.
SarahBrown	training	John Candy	"██████████ was not so far removed from his SCTV days in ""Going Berserk"" and it shows."
SarahBrown	training	John Candy	"If you like the John Candy of ""Only the Lonely"" this is may not be a movie I would advise you to see, but if you enjoy the SCTV days of ██████████, this movie is a must see!"
SarahBrown	training	James Dean et	For those of us Baby Boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Martin Sheen	al., ████████████ showed us The Way in this great feature.
SarahBrown	training	Martin Sheen	 No, this isn't Casablanca, nor is it great Literature, but it IS a serious movie about cars, rebellion, and the genius that is ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Martin	Enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is, and for what ██████ will become.
SarahBrown	training	Macbeth	"Though shot on a small budget in NYC, the film looks and sounds fabulous, and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call ""The Scottish Play,"" as a reference to the word ""███████"" is thought to bring on the play's ancient curse."
SarahBrown	training	Ethan Coen	The film was made up of several segments,each written and/or directed by a different director (most of which were French,but there is a very funny segment directed by Joel & ██████████).
SarahBrown	training	Chan-Wook	█████████ adds some much needed humour into the film, but this is only realised in the final third of the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Mardi Gras	Sharp, well-made documentary focusing on ██████████ beads.
SarahBrown	training	Mardi Gras	Rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox (not that there's anything wrong with that, other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted), this documentary simply shows ██████████ beads, how they are manufactured, by what people, and under what conditions, and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process.
SarahBrown	training	Max	In the first half, we are introduced to ███ and filled in on what drives her.
SarahBrown	training	Max	We also get a few interesting routines with ███ using her abilities to win bets, interacting with a PI, or sorting out co-workers' domestic problems.
SarahBrown	training	Max	Throughout the two halves, ███ finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time.
SarahBrown	training	Max	In the second half, the repercussions catch up with him, and ███ reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess.
SarahBrown	training	Cindy	Original █████ in particular is an annoyance, and I doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes.
SarahBrown	training	Jessica Alba	████████████ is not the worst actor in the world, but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least.
SarahBrown	training	Dark Angel	The fact is that we need more shows like ██████████, where imagination rather than overhype, are used to draw the attention.
SarahBrown	training	Johnny	It had the same style of humour as 'Airplane!'; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities, and recurring characters such as ██████ the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything.
SarahBrown	training	William Shatner	Guest-stars ( including ███████████████! ) were killed off in the opening credits.
SarahBrown	training	Batman	'Police Squad' was the first U.S. sitcom since '██████' to lack a laugh track.
SarahBrown	training	Ettore Scola	████████████ is one of the most important Italian directors.
SarahBrown	training	Ettore Scola	I believe ████████████ is pretty underrated: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films were disappointing.
SarahBrown	training	Gabriele	They're both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Gabriele	████████ is simply an Anti-Fascist.
SarahBrown	training	Ic an't	███████ find it anywhere!
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Kline	███████████, one of the more underrated leading men of recent years, is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome, vulnerable, egotistical and lovable all at the same time.
SarahBrown	training	Kline	Soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh-out-loud one-liners and terrific performances by Field, █████ and Downy, Jr.
SarahBrown	training	Sally Field	But see this for ███████████ who is outstanding.
SarahBrown	training	Jim Craig	The Man From Snowy River II is based upon the return of █████████ to the Snowy River country after a three year absence.
SarahBrown	training	Bruce Rowland	The plot is far more vibrant than the first film, and much more showy, with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film, yet The Man From Snowy River II possesses every essential characteristic of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, a stunning focus of the Australian high country, the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed, and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by █████████████ which equals the first in every way.
SarahBrown	training	Geoff Burrowes	██████████████ has done a superb job with this film, and it is highly worthy of recognition, especially with regard to the quality of the Australian Film Industry.
SarahBrown	training	Jackie Chan	This is an above average ███████████ flick, due to the fantastic finale and great humor, however other then that it's nothing special.
SarahBrown	training	Jackie Chan	All the characters are pretty cool, and the film is entertaining throughout, plus ███████████ is simply amazing in this!.
SarahBrown	training	Jackie	The character development is above average for this sort of thing!, and the main fight is simply fantastic!, plus some of the bumps ██████ takes in this one are harsh!.
SarahBrown	training	Jackie Chan	This is an above average ███████████ flick, due to the fantastic finale, and great humor, however other then that it's nothing great, still it's well worth the watch!.
SarahBrown	training	Jackie Chan	███████████ does a good job here with solid camera work, fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy Delirious	██████████████████████ is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life.
SarahBrown	training	Delirious	You can compare it to any movie, and I garuntee you will decide that █████████ is the funniest movie ever!
SarahBrown	training	Delirious	From this day forward, every great stand up performance will be emulated from █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Harling's	"████████████████ script is near perfect, just check out the ""quotes"" section; on second thought, just rent the DVD, since it's the delivery that really makes the lines sing."
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	This video is so hilariously funny, it makes everything else by ████████████ seem very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which just goes to show you how good this really is).
SarahBrown	training	Bargearse	To be honest, I don't think that I've ever laughed at something as much as this, including Naked Gun and the rarely seen █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ronald	Taken from ██████ 'Taking Sides' Harwood, it's a funny and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two very 'actorly' types.
SarahBrown	training	Ettore Scola	Many directors have turned Greek tragedies into film, many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, has succeeded as admirably as ████████████ in approaching the purity and force of the great Greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting.
SarahBrown	training	Joe Mannix	I particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Amanda	██████ was too dizzy.
SarahBrown	training	Dick Van Dyke	I hope we haven't seen the last of █████████████ and family on our screens, esp.
SarahBrown	training	Sophia Loren	I can't even detect one lip-sync; if we didn't know that was Tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it isn't ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Loren	Most of the actors are excellent; █████ truly marvelous.
SarahBrown	training	Amneris	Her rival ███████ is also terrific.
SarahBrown	training	Verdi	█████ would have enjoyed it!
SarahBrown	training	Renata Tebaldi	Naturally, ██████████████ as Aida is the engine behind the scenes.
SarahBrown	training	William Haines	The film shows that ██████████████ had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him, learns his lesson, and then redeems himself by winning the football game, the polo game, etc.
SarahBrown	training	Pepper	General ██████ has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress.
SarahBrown	training	Peggy	He gets █████ an acting job.
SarahBrown	training	Billy	Eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and █████ part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles.
SarahBrown	training	Peggy	█████ grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	█████ works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive, unappreciated and desperate.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and █████ is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	The colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, ████'s readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	He formulates a plan which utilises █████'s unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	It's now █████'s turn to enter a frightening new world.
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard	The fourth feature from director ███████████████, 'READ MY LIPS' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of ████'s parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.
SarahBrown	training	Lee-Hom Wang	████████████ also shines as the vengeful 'Son' who becomes friends with a grown-up Sho.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	█████ proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	█████ has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself.
SarahBrown	training	Patton	How can someone be remembered as both ██████ and Scrooge?
SarahBrown	training	Scott	█████ does so easily.
SarahBrown	training	Philip Dunne	████████████ here has supplied human beings, a rare achievement in biblical films.
SarahBrown	training	David	█████ is a man in this film, many-sided, not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the Old Testament.
SarahBrown	training	Gregory Peck	████████████ makes him curious, passionate, self-controlled, self-deprecating and appealing.
SarahBrown	training	Hayward	As Bathsheba, ███████ is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of common-sense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the King of Israel would risk so much for her.
SarahBrown	training	Dunne	The familiar storyline provides them little to work with, but author █████ and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations.
SarahBrown	training	Jonathan	Thereafter, he finally is driven from the court of King Saul of Israel, becomes a famous warrior, and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of ████████, the King's son, formerly a friend.
SarahBrown	training	David	█████ agrees.
SarahBrown	training	David	At last, █████ places his hands on the Ark of the Covenant, recently brought to Jerusalem and housed in a temple, which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it, inviting his god to punish him--and nothing happens...
SarahBrown	training	Davenport	Reluctant in the beginning of the treatment, he gets confidence in Dr. █████████ and discloses his childhood, revealing painful traumas generated in his foster house.
SarahBrown	training	Denzel Washington	The direction of █████████████████ is excellent, making sensitive, attractive and with good taste, a story about child abuse.
SarahBrown	training	Mother Night	████████████ is one of my favorite novels and going to see this I was expecting a huge disappointment.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	Instead I got a film that perfectly portrays the irony, humor, elequence, and above all else the crushing sadness of ████████'s novel.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	This is certainly █████'s best preformance to date.
SarahBrown	training	Howard Cambell Jr.	He captures the defeat and selfloathing of ██████████████████ consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes.
SarahBrown	training	Sherryl Lee	███████████ is haunting in her detachment from reality as Cambell's young lover.
SarahBrown	training	John Goodman	"████████████ is understated and more than effective as Cambell's ""Blue Fairy Godmother."""
SarahBrown	training	Mother Night	████████████ is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made.
SarahBrown	training	Céline Sciamma	Not everything is said in this excellent first feature from ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	gore	I'm stymied by harsh, insulting criticism for this film, wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue, pondered one thought or concept, or if all that was desired of this work was the visual ████ of bashing and slashing to satisfy some mindless view of what horror should mean to an audience.
SarahBrown	training	Matador	The ███████ is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it, it seems so light.
SarahBrown	training	Greg Kinnear's	██████████████ character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness, but he's given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film's lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later.
SarahBrown	training	Burns	█████ retired and Matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Simon	Such is the premise of this hilarious ██████████ play made into a movie.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Benjamin	████████████████ shines as Matthau's nephew and agent.
SarahBrown	training	Fritz Feld	"There's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film, and character actor ██████████ starts it all off with a ""pop."""
SarahBrown	training	George Burns	Also, I'm used to seeing Matthau act that way in other movies, but not to ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Benjamin	"████████: ""You have to slide it."""
SarahBrown	training	Pat Boone	Once you get over the image of squeaky clean █████████, as a supposedly bad boy, you'll have no trouble with the rest of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Nick	Considering that, Boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as ████.
SarahBrown	training	Nick	In the early going, he is unreachable and cold, but as he slowly warms up to ████, we see that he's really a pretty good guy.
SarahBrown	training	Liz	As ███, she's gorgeous to look at, great to listen to, and quite funny at times.
SarahBrown	training	Andy Griffith	Think of it as the old █████████████ show with musical numbers, a little more plot, and wide screen Technicolor.
SarahBrown	training	Jones	The chemistry between █████ and Boone is good.
SarahBrown	training	Oprah	Also the acting performances are superb - especially █████ who I now have a new found respect for.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Bloch	"From the mind of ████████████, of ""Psycho"" fame, come four tales of twisty terror in this Amicus anthology film, which, while not quite as much fun, or scary, as I would have liked, still provides for some decent genre entertainment."
SarahBrown	training	John Bennett	It's linked by the wrap-around story of a highly skeptical Scotland Yard detective (████████████) who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor; he's advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place, and our film is off and running.
SarahBrown	training	Cushing	Most effective in this episode is the dream sequence, although it's great as always to watch ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Jon Pertwee	"""The Cloak"" has the most outright comedy of the four; ███████████, one of many actors to have played the role of Dr. Who over the years, is a lot of fun as a vain, temperamental horror movie star (in fact, he's the highlight of this story) who, infuriated with the lack of quality in his latest low-budget film, goes out and buys his own cloak."
SarahBrown	training	Holloway	The wrap-up story then concludes in a predictable but still effective way as Detective Inspector ████████ learns that he should have taken all of the warnings given him more seriously.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Dress's	"Underscored by ███████████████ unusual, striking, and eerie score, ""The House That Dripped Blood"" is an entertaining mix of stories; while I don't enjoy it quite as much as, say, ""Tales from the Crypt"", it's still good fun."
SarahBrown	training	John Turtorro	█████████████ doesn't really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic chess player, not to speak of the Italian player.
SarahBrown	training	Darkheart	 Anyhow, the demon's name is █████████ and he wants this chick to help him get the Care Bears in return for him giving her special powers.
SarahBrown	training	Darkheart	And did I mention that █████████ appears to the girl most often as a WHINEY VOICED 10 YEAR OLD BOY???
SarahBrown	training	Ruben Santiago-Hudson	This child, █████████████████████ wrote the screenplay.
SarahBrown	training	Merkerson	 But make no mistake; see this film for the amazing performance of █████████, who is brilliant in this role.
SarahBrown	training	Emmy	*Merkerson has already won an ████, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild for this role.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur Bach	███████████ needs to grow up, but that is unfortunately not the only thing he needs to do.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	██████ is an interesting fellow.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	Working just rubs ██████ the wrong way - he likes to have fun, womanize, and of course, drink.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	Drinking gives ██████ a sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; and while that gets him into all sorts of trouble, it's absolutely hilarious to watch on screen.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Gielgud won the Best Supporting Actor █████ for his performance in this film, and there's no doubting why.
SarahBrown	training	Jackie Chan's	Unlike other Chinese action movies, which were always period pieces or (in the wake of █████████████ Police Story I) cop dramas, Pedicab Driver gives us a look at contemporary rural China.
SarahBrown	training	James Michener	The books of ██████████████ taking readers to faraway places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s.
SarahBrown	training	Joshua Logan	████████████ was on familiar ground.
SarahBrown	training	Logan	With a sure hand, █████ assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story.
SarahBrown	training	Miyoshi	It got a great deal of attention because at the time of the Academy Awards, ███████ was starring on Broadway in Flower Drum Song.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	That █████ symbolized something else too.
SarahBrown	training	Logan	If Sayonara were done today, █████ would never get away with it.
SarahBrown	training	Montalban	But █████████ is fine.
SarahBrown	training	Gregg Giuffria	Keyboardist ██████████████ remains the bands highlight, and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut, ever!
SarahBrown	training	Clouzot	Well now the movie takes a more conventional turn so to speak (███████'s misanthropy maybe)but just for a while.
SarahBrown	training	Maupassant	In a scene with his shrink ,the hero says the writer's madness was only the expression of his disgust for Man and he draws a parallel between his despair and ██████████'s one.
SarahBrown	training	Jesse	Hey now, I can't claim to have seen all of the films of █████ (Jesus) Franco, and there sure seem to be a lot of them, but this is one of the better (and weirder) of the lot that I have seen.
SarahBrown	training	Hitchcock	The main reason for that is because it was compared to a █████████ movie.
SarahBrown	training	Hitchcock	In my opinion █████████ has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some (cheap) thrillers, but on the other hand I must admit that I was intrigued by it because this is a European movie.
SarahBrown	training	Hitchcock	Normally it's the big Hollywood studios who like to abuse █████████'s name if that can raise their income.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	"""Sur mes lèvres"" or ""Read my Lips"" as it is called in English, tells the story of a young secretary named █████."
SarahBrown	training	Paul Angeli	███████████ is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex-convict.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	The man is a thief, but █████ gives him a chance and covers for him when needed.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and █████ the typically helpless woman, but thanks to their performances, you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together.
SarahBrown	training	Bugs	In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and ████ is a little unusual.
SarahBrown	training	David Attenborough	"I've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini-series, ""Planet Earth,"" narrated by my childhood idol ██████████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Brian Bonsall	█████████████ is a smart actor anyway.
SarahBrown	training	Nader	My father and I were big fans as I was already a big science/electronics nut, (still am) and my father was an old school chum of █████.
SarahBrown	training	Mulligan	" It's a generic coming-of-age story -- think ""The Member of the Wedding,"" ""Summer of '42,"" ""A Summer Place,"" even ""Little Women"" -- and there are moments where ████████ might have omitted the soupy music, not used slow-motion, or played down the golden-lit prettiness of the setting."
SarahBrown	training	Witherspoon	In particular, ███████████ is excellent: Her line readings are fresh and original, and her body language is just right for a gawky, hoydenish 14-year-old on the eve of womanhood.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier	Now I'd be the first to hail ██████████████ a genius just off the back of his films Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, but this is stupid, the fact that Europa has gone un-noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema, whilst overrated rubbish like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Life is Beautiful clean up at the academy awards (but what do the know)
SarahBrown	training	von Trier	Much like his first film The Element of Crime, █████████ uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world, and much like Element, the film begins with the main character (or in the case of Europa, we the audience) being hypnotized.
SarahBrown	training	Max von Sydow	As we move down the tracks, the voice of the Narrator (█████████████) counts us down into a deep sleep, until we awake in Europa.
SarahBrown	training	von Trier	 The performances are good, they may not be on par with performances in later █████████ films, but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round.
SarahBrown	training	Jean-Marc Barr	But I would like to point out the fantastic performance of ██████████████ in the lead role, whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides, until he erupts in the films final act.
SarahBrown	training	von Trier	Europa is a tremendous film, and I cant help thinking what a shame that █████████ has abandoned this way of filming, since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time, Europa, much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes.
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	In fact, the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller, and only lawyer ███████████ has the answer.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	Darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director-writer ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	Yuppie lawyer ███████████ is supposed to defend them in a white man's court.
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	One reason the movie works is the background normalcy of ███████████'s wife and little daughters.
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	███████████ underplays throughout, especially during the underground discovery tour where I think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does.
SarahBrown	training	GEORGE NADER	With the death of ████████████, on 4 February 2002, I thought of this most interesting program, which even though it had only a short run, was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout.
SarahBrown	training	JOHN PAUL STAPP	"The opening credits showed many differing images, one of which was a snippit of COLONEL ███████████████, riding his famed rocket sled, at the point where he was often referred to as ""The Fastest Man Alive""."
SarahBrown	training	Romance	Mood: Action, ███████, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points.
SarahBrown	training	Robert De Niro	Once again, I will NEVER look and ██████████████ the same again.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	█████████████ somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming.
SarahBrown	training	Graham Norton	█████████████ was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this.
SarahBrown	training	Slavoj Zizek	Not as salacious as it sounds, this is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) featuring Slovenian superstar philosopher/psychoanalyst ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	█████ takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	My only real issue with this is that █████ picked films that were quite obviously filled with Freudian themes.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	█████ is very funny, and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he's discussing.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	The only thing that bothers me about the movie is ███████ dieing.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Corman	It is was produced by ████████████, who at this point had already produced a few WIPs.
SarahBrown	training	Demme	Writer-director █████ really gets into his job, always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario.
SarahBrown	training	Demme	But do not worry, █████ still operates within the parameters of the sub-genre.
SarahBrown	training	Roberta Collins	███████████████ is a WIP veteran, so she does not need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is a hoot as the wheelchair-bound crazy warden.
SarahBrown	training	Pam Grier	█████████ is sorely missed, though.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks mystique	In this early French film, the whole ██████████████████████ is fleshed out powerfully with a conjunction of image, song and music.
SarahBrown	training	Brooks	The Charleston is what seems most associated with ██████ (she was the first to dance it in Europe), but the essence of the actress comes across more strongly in the tango.
SarahBrown	training	Andre	Later, when she has forsaken her fame in favor of a mundane existence as the wife of jealous husband █████, the longing for her forsaken fame becomes apparent when the same tango record is seen on her apartment record player.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks'	The brazen and forceful quality of the tango epitomizes ██████████████ strong-headed but elegant and erotic individuality.
SarahBrown	training	Je n'ai qu'un amour	" The song, ""███████████████████, c'est toi,"" adds an immense amount of pathos to what is not a great film (but a very good one)."
SarahBrown	training	Edith Piaf	By the way, Brooks' voice was not dubbed for the film by ██████████ as some have claimed.
SarahBrown	training	Piaf	████ was born in 1915, and wasn't discovered until 1935.
SarahBrown	training	Andre	It continues on screen after husband █████, who has followed her to the screening room, shoots and kills her.
SarahBrown	training	Andre	As █████ watches his now dead wife sing to him on screen, the murder weapon still smoking, he subtly smiles.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	" Coincidentally, █████████████ real life career crashed and burned after ""Prix de Beaute,"" so it was also the death of her final starring roll as well."
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter	But after the untimely passing of ███████████, the show became more about coping with the loss of a loved one...
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter's	But then I read about █████████████ death...
SarahBrown	training	CJ	But the true gem is ██...who is absolutely hilarious as the wild cousin.
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter's	It will always be █████████████ masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Lars Von Trier	Someone release this movie on DVD so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so-called films of the 1990's and see how vapid they were for the most part, and how ██████████████ tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	█████████ brilliantly paints his vision on screen.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	 For some reason, █████████ got caught up in his own Dogma movement shortly after this.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	"""Bend It Like ███████"" is an absolute treat from beginning to end."
SarahBrown	training	Erik Weihenmeyer	On one hand, there is ████████████████, the first blind man to climb Everest, and the team of (sighted) mountaineers who are guiding the kids.
SarahBrown	training	Sabriye Tenberken	On the other, there is █████████████████, a blind woman who runs the first school for blind Tibetans, who agrees to the expedition but subsequently has doubts about how it is progressing.
SarahBrown	training	Sabine	At some level, ██████ simply doesn't understand the mountaineer's philosophy (with it's emphasis on summitting); she is probably right in identifying the mismatch between the mountaineers goals and the desires of the children but her certainty in her own correctness makes her a hard person to sympathise with, especially as she has an effective veto.
SarahBrown	training	BLANDINGS	Although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as █████████, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	Although █████████ has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 he is making $15,000.00 a year, which was like making $90,000.00 today), and lives in a luxury apartment - which in the New York City of that day he rents!
SarahBrown	training	Muriel	He and ██████ take a drive into the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want.
SarahBrown	training	Bill	████ points out he's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	There are problems about water supply that both █████████ just never think about, such as hard and soft water - which leads to the Zis - Zis Water softening machine.
SarahBrown	training	Jim	 The escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils ███.
SarahBrown	training	Jim	███ can't get a grip on this (he's not alone - one or two other executives fumbled it before him).
SarahBrown	training	Jim	They can't open the door, and ███ (in a panic) tries breaking the door down by a make-shift battering ram.
SarahBrown	training	Loy	You can imagine though how the no-nonsense Parnell handles the situation afterward, when ███ leaves him with his paint crew.
SarahBrown	training	Sopranos	Why Panic never got a good theatrical release is easily seen: it's much too smart, and audiences would have probably had a difficult time with it, comparing it to American Beauty in its probing of a midlife crisis, and ████████ and Analyze This in it's study of illegal goings-on amidst family life.
SarahBrown	training	Brommel	Though Panic may seem to derive from unoriginal material, ███████'s lifelike characters coupled with deft dialogue and observant direction make the film a realistic look at the undoing of a middle aged man.
SarahBrown	training	Ullman	He leads a double life, with his wife (██████) and son unaware of his real trade.
SarahBrown	training	Henry Brommel	The fact that writer/director █████████████ decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract-killing is disposable.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	In ████, Macy creates a tragic, easily sympathetic character, and turns in yet another brooding, great performance, as can always be expected.
SarahBrown	training	Henry Brommel's	███████████████ first feature, Panic is a film that is well-crafted in its sincerity.
SarahBrown	training	Alice	"And yet it can't be the whole story, because the two least glossy - ""█████ in Wonderland"" and ""Peter Pan"" - are also the weakest."
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	I'll swear that some of the humans are rotoscoped - but then, the rotoscoped humans (including ██████████ herself) aren't full-blooded characters in the script, so this approach works well enough.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	The mice, for instance, are the creatures who draw us into the story; but they are really representatives or allies of the more colourless ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lucifer	The cat, ███████, is a kind of witch's familiar to the Wicked Stepmother.
SarahBrown	training	Ward Kimball	The supervising animator was ████████████ and he modelled it on his own cat.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	The Grand Duke is a put-upon character who deserves to be lifted out of his sphere as much as ██████████ does.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	For a woman like ████, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top.
SarahBrown	training	Goebbels	"The idea of getting to ████████ wasn't impossible for her, so that became our hook."""
SarahBrown	training	Lisa Huttner	Jan ████████████ FILMS FOR TWO
SarahBrown	training	Lucille La Verne	If you ask me, the stepmother (voice of ████████████████) was truly diabolical.
SarahBrown	training	Candy	"For instance, when his soon-to-be father-in-law asks him how much he earns, █████ says ""Oh, I pull down anywhere between thirty and...eleven thousand dollars a year, sir."""
SarahBrown	training	Candy	Oh course, it is █████'s delivery that sells it.
SarahBrown	training	Eugene Levy	███████████ also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker.
SarahBrown	training	Burt	A strangely enjoyable effort, combining an appropriately far-fetched plot involving Adam and ████ and flashbacks to the original TV series.
SarahBrown	training	Burt Ward's	"Most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from ███████████ book ""Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights"" and I imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie."
SarahBrown	training	Currie	Foster, giving one of her most perceptive, affecting and underrated performances to date, is basically the group's den mother who presides over the well-being of both herself and the others; she's especially concerned about the good-hearted, but reckless and self-destructive ██████, whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end.
SarahBrown	training	Leon Bijou's	████████████ soft, dewy, almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence.
SarahBrown	training	Currie	"Achingly authentic, engrossing and deeply moving (██████'s grim ultimate fate is very heart-breaking), ""Foxes"" is quite simply one of the most unsung and under-appreciated teen movies made about early 80's adolescence."
SarahBrown	training	Yubb Nubb	█████████!
SarahBrown	training	Vader	So those of you who are complaining that █████'s helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it.
SarahBrown	training	Hamill	██████ does an excellent job with his dramatic character development.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	She killed █████ even when so many others had failed!).
SarahBrown	training	Harrison Ford	█████████████ - need I say more?
SarahBrown	training	Luke	"The best climax is when ████ shouts ""NOOO!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle."
SarahBrown	training	John Williams	█████████████ is nothing short of a genius!
SarahBrown	training	AMRITA RAO	I think ██████████ - looks very good & she has acted very well.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid Kapur -	She has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to ██████████████ who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance.
SarahBrown	training	Maine Pyar Kiya	Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after ███████████████, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain.
SarahBrown	training	AMRITA RAO	it seems ██████████ - our actress-from-Vivah {Result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006 !!
SarahBrown	training	Dilip Kumar	Imagine, to share the same pedestal as the legendary ███████████ ..........
SarahBrown	training	Amrita Rao	Congrats to ██████████ - for taking her Career to another level with this award ....
SarahBrown	training	Shahid Kapur	I personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with ████████████ !!
SarahBrown	training	Chawla	They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi ██████} .................
SarahBrown	training	Amrita Rao	 Some points that I observed,few of the elements :- #1 If u notice carefully, ██████████ looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid Kapur	Fit #2 ████████████ is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage ....
SarahBrown	training	Anupam Kher	but PREM listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Amrita	"Eventually ""Honesty"" & ""Trust"" are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with ██████."
SarahBrown	training	Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao	#4 I really liked the relationship shown between █████████████████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Fanaa	IN FACT - i think Vivah does deserve better viewing/business than Dhoom2 or █████ or Golmaal or all those time-pass/fuzzy/style/crap movies !!
SarahBrown	training	Josie Lawrence	██████████████, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes.
SarahBrown	training	Diane Keaton	the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted... however, I felt that ████████████ was at her best... the scene where she has cravings, and begins rummaging her home for cocaine... was the best...
SarahBrown	training	Lynda Boyd	the two boys are good, and ██████████ also showed what a good actress she is....
SarahBrown	training	Mukhsin	I thought that ███████ has been wonderfully written.
SarahBrown	training	Yasmin	There's tonnes of subtle messages that i think ██████ was trying to bring across.
SarahBrown	training	Gubra	Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from █████.
SarahBrown	training	Iris	████ discovers that Stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen.
SarahBrown	training	Robert DeNiro	However, █████████████ is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect.
SarahBrown	training	Jim Kouf	████████, the director and screenwriter, is very laid-back; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Nicholson's	Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by ████████████████ descent into madness.
SarahBrown	training	Hitchcock	It has the classic mystery of █████████ and the terror of a modern thriller.
SarahBrown	training	Norman Jewison	Each of these performers, plus ██████████████ as Director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work.
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	None quite equals ██████████!
SarahBrown	training	t.v.	I'm surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this ████ movie...as far as I'm aware, the series itself, has had a huge following, reviewer pundits and real people alike, have praised it to a person.
SarahBrown	training	Tennison	"This abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama - it's very skilfully dealt with, in less than a couple of minutes screentime, a marvel of economy in scripting, and editing - but it's always there, as a counterpoint to ████████'s desperate efforts to find another ""lost child"" - a kidnap victim - before it's too late."
SarahBrown	training	Tennison	The story takes many twists and turns,before the surprise ending, and one is fascinated, alike, by the plot, and characters (although I found the many villains a little overdrawn), the police, and especially ████████, herself, are not always competent, nor that likeable, which figures, given the unpleasant job that they have to do, in the sleazy underworld which this series, habitually inhabits.
SarahBrown	training	Mirren	"██████, herself, has said that she'll make no more movies in the series, but, excellent as she's always been in the role of Tennison, the series, itself, is as ""actor proof"" as is another addiction of mine"
SarahBrown	training	"-Dick Wolf's American""Law & Order"	"█████████████████████████████████"" - whoever appears therein, each could go on forever."
SarahBrown	training	Hannah	After ██████'s father died, her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she hasn't been very religious before.
SarahBrown	training	Hannah	She doesn't know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from, but as she starts digging in her mother's troubled childhood, ██████ understands how little she has ever known about her mother's past.
SarahBrown	training	Aryian	(For those who didn't know this yet: Being married to a so-called pure ██████ man or woman meant for many Jews that they weren't immediately sent to one of the concentration camps, but that they had to work in a factory).
SarahBrown	training	Rosenstrasse	How difficult it sometimes was for them during the Nazi regime and how these people, most of the time women, did everything within their power to free their men, once they were captured and locked away in for instance the ████████████...
SarahBrown	training	Hannah	At least of the part that is situated in the USA, because the part where ██████ goes to Berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother's past, definitely works.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	Lots and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen █████, you know his pace.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	To be sure, █████ is never boring, but if you don't buy (or if you mind) the psycho analytics, then you'll be annoyed to no end.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	 But you should not be, as the setting, clips, the way the film interleave with these clips, █████'s points are never boring.
SarahBrown	training	Kate	Thanks ████
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi/Karloff	"It gets no better than ██████████████ in this incredibly good ""mood"" type motion picture."
SarahBrown	training	Lucille Ball	Davies, in my view, was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Hayworth	████████ isn't even that much of a dancer, but she has a lot of 'inexperienced' charm that fits her character.
SarahBrown	training	Raoul Walsh's	The only thing missing is a good reason for remaking █████████████ High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame, and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original.
SarahBrown	training	Palance	Biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel, ███████ (to Winter's chagrin) offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl's deformity, a gesture that backfires.
SarahBrown	training	Palance	On the lam, ███████ moves higher into the cold Sierras....
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	I was impressed with ███████████, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness.
SarahBrown	training	Shabana Azmi	But I was even more impressed with ████████████, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Russel	Touching, action-packed, and perfect for ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Not an undue amount of ████ or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that respect.
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter	███████████ has never been better and has the best line in the movie!
SarahBrown	training	Sam	"""███"" hits close to home, is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with."
SarahBrown	training	Ben Gazzara	███████████ was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	I'm sure I've met ██████ in my travels somewhere.
SarahBrown	training	Jess	████ is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	Bend it Like ███████ is a very funny feel good movie that doesn't need to be deep and complex, it's just fine as it is.
SarahBrown	training	Danny McGuire's	Unfortunately, her career is getting no where in ███████████████ Night Club.
SarahBrown	training	Grandma	She reminds the publisher of her ███████, who he was deeply in love with many years ago.
SarahBrown	training	Rita	I had never seen ████ before this, and I am so glad I did!
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly's	One thing I didn't like was ████████████ character.
SarahBrown	training	Rita Hayworth's	Not everyone's ideal movie, but a wonderful movie nonetheless, due to ███████████████ star power.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dickens'	████████████████ story is captured in outstanding fashion here.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	███████████████ is absolutely amazing and totally believable as Scrooge.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	"The game ""similes"" ███████'s nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item."
SarahBrown	training	God Bless	Enjoy ... and █████████ Us, Every One!
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Reeve	█████████████████ does a good job as being an ex-con/drifter.
SarahBrown	training	J.T. Walsh	██████████ does a nice job, not his best role, but, still....a nice job.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	The actors (███████████████ and others) are great!
SarahBrown	training	Pakeezah	████████ is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition; the photography, sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene, are so charged with symbolism and meaning, that the viewer is left breathless.
SarahBrown	training	Ernst Lubitsch	"""The Shop Around the Corner"" is one of the great films from director ██████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Chan	This film feels as though ████ wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme, only to abandon the effort, possibly due to time and budget.
SarahBrown	training	Chan	This is an important turning point film in ████'s career, because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns - which is why there's such a lack of kung fu throughout the film.
SarahBrown	training	Chan	████ wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it.
SarahBrown	training	Chan	This film represents an effort on ████'s part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time.
SarahBrown	training	Chan	"It doesn't quite work, and ████ would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films, with the making of the contemporary action comedy ""Police Story""."
SarahBrown	training	Chan	But going back to view this film is still very informative as to how ████ worked his way through the historical genre, and perhaps why he abandoned it.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	If you're a fan of █████████ and Chinese fantasy films, you should love this.
SarahBrown	training	Stormriders	If you liked ███████████ or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, this one should be right up your alley.
SarahBrown	training	Joan	In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, ████'s story has unexpected resonance.
SarahBrown	training	Joyce	"█████'s eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy, it offers many wildly ""perverse"" episodes."
SarahBrown	training	Joyce	It is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the Irish acting profession of the 1960s, respected players all, daring to utter and enact █████'s hugely transgressive text with such gusto.
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	Speaking of ███████████, what an amazing end to such an iconic character.
SarahBrown	training	Mark Harmon	I have to admit though that ███████████ really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as Capano's and the behavior that Capano exhibited throughout this period.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Carper	In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I have met ██████████ many times at various functions (a good man, despite being a politician) and I am so glad that he pulled the strings in the Federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime.
SarahBrown	training	Odysseus	I was moved by the plight of ████████ and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which was felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals.
SarahBrown	training	Homer	As in █████'s work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by classical statuary).
SarahBrown	training	Gibney	"██████ might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played Halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the ""house"" as the main suspect."
SarahBrown	training	Oscars	Why didn't this pick up a bag full of ██████?
SarahBrown	training	Zefferelli	No ██████████ here, just great storytelling the way only film can, but rarely does.
SarahBrown	training	Thierry	Can the relationship between ███████ and Zandalee be salvaged?
SarahBrown	training	Anderson	Better still, this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity (the gorgeously statuesque ████████ looks smoking hot in the buff) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes (Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight).
SarahBrown	training	Johnny	"With his long, scruffy black hair, greasy mustache, foul mouth, and coarse manners, Cage's ██████ is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing ""romantic"" lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid."
SarahBrown	training	Walt Lloyd's	████████████ sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	██████████, who was on loan to Columbia from MGM, matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done.
SarahBrown	training	Bette Midler	████████████ is indescribable in this concert.
SarahBrown	training	Bette Midler	Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads, ████████████ moves her audience.
SarahBrown	training	Bette	If you can't see it live (which is the best way to see █████) then this is the next best thing.
SarahBrown	training	James	One of the campers, █████, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts, and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on.
SarahBrown	training	Full Moon	Granted, like many █████████ films, this has little or no budget.
SarahBrown	training	Tyrannus	It looks like there were attempts at research for the script too, because, even though ████████ really doesn't act much like a gladiator until the end, at least he speaks Latin.
SarahBrown	training	a Psycho Killer	It Had Black Humor, Good Suspense, Nice Looking Girls, and Of Course, ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Gore	Except we Are Left with a Small Amount of ████ and Nudity because It Was Made for Television.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	 I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the ███████████ novel which I am now looking to read) and colorful characters.
SarahBrown	training	Best Picture	I had the opportunity to see this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, in which it won an award for ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Adam Jones	The writer-director ██████████, who I believe also won an award for his writing, does an excellent job with direction.
SarahBrown	training	Cross Eyed	██████████ will keep you laughing throughout the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ In my opinion greatest love story ever told i loved it as a kid and i love it now a wonderful Disney masterpiece this is 1 of my favorite movies i love Disney.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	i could rave on and on about ██████████ and Disney all day
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	Cinderellas evil step mother and step sisters try to prevent her attendance ██████████ finally gets her dream and wish and is able to attend her captive beauty , Genorisity and beautiful nature help her win her prince.
SarahBrown	training	Zhu Warriors	████████████ struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking.
SarahBrown	training	Udo Kier	This time, ████████ plays two parts, as the monster baby and his demon-like father.
SarahBrown	training	Morten Rotne Leffers	Sadly, ████████████████████, the Down´s Syndrome dishwasher #2, died shortly after, as well.
SarahBrown	training	Stellan Skarsgård	Look for █████████████████ in a cameo.
SarahBrown	training	JP Sarro	The opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer ████████ uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment.
SarahBrown	training	Sarro	However, █████ was not alone in this epic undertaking.
SarahBrown	training	Tim Sheridan	The writing, provided by scribe ████████████, was just as breathtaking.
SarahBrown	training	Vanessa	where ███████ reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time, is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings I have ever seen.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Towne	Sheridan is the next ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Greta Garbo's	█████████████ American film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions, as in a torrent, causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way.
SarahBrown	training	Ricardo	███████ is in love with her too, but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother.
SarahBrown	training	Rafael	In reality, part of her attitude is bitterness over ██████'s abandonment.
SarahBrown	training	Rafael	She returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	See this one as █████'s American film debut and a precursor of things to come
SarahBrown	training	Guy Kibbee	██████████ gives the viewer a lot of laughs.
SarahBrown	training	Warren William	██████████████, a very, under rated actor, is superb in giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, he teaches him to say something which means nothing to the voting public.
SarahBrown	training	Morgan	Hiring a private detective, Mr. ██████ confirms his wife of 22 years is having sex with one of his younger employees.
SarahBrown	training	Nanavati	████████ knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen.
SarahBrown	training	Simba	The Lion King told the story from the side of █████ the young lion, 1 and a half is from the view of Timone and Pumbaa, a less than perfect duo made up of a meercat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and a warthog who has an odor issue.
SarahBrown	training	Lee	The young ███ is living in NY in the 80's when hip hop was at its beginning.
SarahBrown	training	Lee	The movie follows ███ in his average day, dancing, graffitiing, etc.
SarahBrown	training	Melle Mel	The movie has old school features such as Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster █████████ & the Furious Five, the Rock Steady Crew, the New York City Breakers, and many more....
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter	"Over the years, we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what, keeping ""8 Simple Rules"" going after ███████████ died comes to mind, but this is probably the first time I cared."
SarahBrown	training	Leo	They tried to cover it up with a comeback of ███ and increasingly outrageous story lines, but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	The last season felt like the season too much for every single character, simply because ████ used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	They also brought in the standard cousin ██████, only this time it just wasn't a kid.
SarahBrown	training	Donna	I think more than half of the last season was █████ pretending to be amused.
SarahBrown	training	Topher Grace	To be fair, the last episode, also because it had a cameo by ████████████ (a cameo in his own show), was really good, even if not that funny either.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Claudel	It is ████████████ reduced to beauty salon magazine standards.
SarahBrown	training	Julien Duvivier	"A historical note on this sort of ""women's subject"": The following year (1937), ███████████████, visibly inspired by ""The Garden of Allah"", directed ""Carnet de Bal"", where a very similar clothes-horse butter-won't-melt-in-her-mouth heroine (widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic Alpine lakeside villa) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book."
SarahBrown	training	Duvivier	It was ████████'s cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	"Great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with ""██████."""
SarahBrown	training	Kim Longinotto	"It was shown in Göteborg together with a retrospective dedicated to ██████████████, ""director in focus"" of the festival."
SarahBrown	training	Ed Wood	I heard that ███████ wrote the story in 10 years!
SarahBrown	training	Wood	Well, if you take the film seriously (like mr. ████ did) it is really one of the worst films you will ever see.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Zane's	████████████ role is absolutely excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Reese Witherspoon	█████████████████ first outing on the big screen was a memorable one.
SarahBrown	training	Reese	"She appears like a fresh scrubbed face ""tween"" slight and stringy, but undeniably █████."
SarahBrown	training	Reese	I actually gained some respect for █████ to know who she was so early on.
SarahBrown	training	Orgazmo	A comedy of epically funny proportions from the guys that brought you South Park, and most of the guys from ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Brady	Quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of █████'s films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm.
SarahBrown	training	David Attenborough	However beautiful, a large part of the footage I had already seen in the TV series 'Planet Earth', narrated by ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Attenborough	I found ████████████'s narration of Planet Earth to be much better than the narration of Earth.
SarahBrown	training	Attenborough	It skips much of the scientific detail that ████████████ covers in his 'Planet Earth' series.
SarahBrown	training	Jane Fonda	I have every reason to dislike ██████████ for her Vietnam era actions, but personal feelings apart, she is fabulous in this role.
SarahBrown	training	Robert DeNiro	█████████████ is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities.
SarahBrown	training	DeNiro	This is the first I have seen ██████ using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	Worry not, Disney fans--this special edition DVD of the beloved ██████████ won't turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight.
SarahBrown	training	Brothers Grimm	"One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the Disney-fide adaptation of the gory ██████████████ fairy tale became a classic in its own right, thanks to some memorable tunes (including ""A Dream Is a Wish"
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	this uppity ██████████ thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	There are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, ██████████ is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout.
SarahBrown	training	Peggy Pepper	What gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, ████████████, whose acting is the talk of Savannah trying to make it on the big screen.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	"Many stars of the silent era have cameos in ""Show People,"" including ██████ herself without the curly hair and makeup."
SarahBrown	training	Davies	██████ was adorable and a lively comedienne.
SarahBrown	training	William Haines	It's a shame ██████████████ quit the movies - he was cute and energetic, deservedly an enormous star back in the day.
SarahBrown	training	Mary Ellen-Trainor)has	A woman (██████████████████████ just murdered her hubby on Christmas Eve for his life insurance.
SarahBrown	training	Larry Drake	What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged, Santa Clause suit wearing psychopath (███████████, perfectly over the top) threatens her life...as well as her precious young daughters.
SarahBrown	training	Crypt	Most notable for it's escalating suspense and narrative twists, And All Through The Houst is among Tales From The █████'s best.
SarahBrown	training	Julian	Despite their completely different personalities and ██████'s crude and insensible remarks, they become friends.
SarahBrown	training	James Bond	He proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just ██████████ or cold-war spies.
SarahBrown	training	Norma Khouri's	Forbidden Lie$(2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of ██████████████ book Forbidden Love, and THAT was a best-seller.
SarahBrown	training	Lie$	An onion-peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman, ████ is the very best in editorialised reality TV.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	This █████-worthy effort is at once genuinely funny, upsetting, and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another.
SarahBrown	training	Rachel Richardson	"Clearly these friends are now ""turned"", the funniest on-camera line belonging to Khouri's QLD neighbour █████████████████ who speaks her disillusionment in flat, no-nonsense colloquialisms: ""I think it's a load of sh!t."
SarahBrown	training	Anna	████ opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by Khouri herself.
SarahBrown	training	Khouri	The publishing houses across 4 continents who'd jumped at the chance to publish first-time author ██████ never tried to check any facts.
SarahBrown	training	Broinowski	"Eventually ██████████ forces her (con)""Artist"" to admit the decade-discrepancy in her story, and it's after this that Khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera."
SarahBrown	training	Jeremy	"Secret, because in it Khouri's ""American security guard"" ██████ is heard to have an Australian accent: he's an actor!"
SarahBrown	training	Anna	(We never find out how ████ uncovered it.)
SarahBrown	training	Anna Broinowski	███████████████ (watch-list her now) is even clever enough to use the one artistic device (key players cross-commenting on footage) to kill two birds--making her audiences want to drink from the same well again.
SarahBrown	training	Broinowski	██████████ MADE ME LOOK.(10/10)
SarahBrown	training	Tom Noonan	The incredible performance by ██████████ is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired.
SarahBrown	training	sci-fi-asco	I rented this film from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood for what I thought would be a silly '50s ███████████ and because it is the first feature-length Superman film.
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	There is nothing not to like about ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	LaBoheme	I fell in love with ████████ because of this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	On my list of favorite movies, ██████████ is number 3.
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	I always put ██████████ on when there's nothing good to watch because it makes me happy.
SarahBrown	training	Gordon	██████ directs in a style that reminds you of Vonneguts writing styles.
SarahBrown	training	Arkin	Nolte, Goodman, and █████ are all incredible.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of ███████ to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff Webster	Even before the film properly begins he (as ████████████) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle).
SarahBrown	training	Gannon	The problem is that neither Smith nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as ██████ in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	███████'s herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine)
SarahBrown	training	Jeff	"However, she has a similar ""I only trust myself"" attitude to ████."
SarahBrown	training	Dawson	She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	He, ███, and Rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle.
SarahBrown	training	Dawson	After he is proved right, they go by his route and reach ██████ only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff	And will ████ remain neutral?
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	The performances are dandy here, including ███████ as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough.
SarahBrown	training	Brennan	███████ is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results.
SarahBrown	training	Calvert	"And ███████ is both a voice of conscience and a frontier ""Gigi"" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman."
SarahBrown	training	John Ford	Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Mann	████ certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.
SarahBrown	training	Zuf	cheers ███
SarahBrown	training	Mitzi Kapture	It's hard for me to criticize anything that █████████████ does.
SarahBrown	training	Zack	I would have liked to have seen more closure with ████'s death and possibly closure with her husband.
SarahBrown	training	Richard	It was a very fitting end for ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Mitzi ROCKED	Of course, ████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Griffith	████████ achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways.
SarahBrown	training	Biograph	While the typical ████████ short might utilise a dozen or more sets, The Sealed Room features only two adjoining rooms  the king's court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Leonard	This movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers, in which ██████████████ tears off flower petals one-by-one.
SarahBrown	training	Griffith	At this point, ████████ was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the cross-cut.
SarahBrown	training	Griffith	"The dramatic ""ride-to-the-rescue"", here absent, was later to become a standard climax to ████████'s pictures."
SarahBrown	training	Lambert Hillyer's	"This formula would be repeated in several films through the decade, and director █████████████████ mix of horror and science fiction, ""The Invisible Ray"", is another of those minor classics they did in those years."
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	After this marvelous discovery, Dr. ████ decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to Africa, looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor.
SarahBrown	training	Lambert Hillyer	A seasoned director of low-budget B-movies, filmmaker ███████████████ got the chance to make 3 films for Universal Pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles.
SarahBrown	training	Boris Karloff	As the film's protagonist, █████████████ is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Lawton	████████████ is also good in his role, but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast.
SarahBrown	training	Lambert Hillyer's	"While nowhere near the Gothic expressionism of the ""Frankenstein"" movies, nor the elegant suspense of ""The Black Cat"", █████████████████ ""The Invisible Ray"" is definitely a minor classic amongst Universal Pictures' catalog of horror films."
SarahBrown	training	John stole	Yes, I agree, Sir ██████████ absolutely every scene.
SarahBrown	training	Dudley Moore	God rest ████████████; this was such an enjoyable movie.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Eustache	Unfortunately, █████████████ (1938-1981) belongs like so many once leading French film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international DVDs.
SarahBrown	training	Jean-Pierre Léaud	The dialogs are basically monologues, mainly the longest ones spoken by █████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	"It is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas, but the type of man █████████ exists to all times, we find him already in Petron's ""Satiricon"", which work has actually great resemblance with ""The Mother and the Whore""."
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	█████████ does not only nothing, but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting, at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is.
SarahBrown	training	Nietzsche	He is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between █████████ and Bernanos.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	However, the intellectual speeches of █████████ seem to be rather pseudo-intellectual, and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective books.
SarahBrown	training	Ruben Santiago-Hudson	Based upon the experiences of writer-actor █████████████████████, the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s.
SarahBrown	training	S. Epatha Merkerson	As delivered by actress ███████████████████, that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger temper is frozen in his tracks.
SarahBrown	training	Merkerson	 From start to finish, █████████ delivers a commanding presence Her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home.
SarahBrown	training	Merkerson	As played by █████████, the character of Nanny simply radiates love.
SarahBrown	training	Doodlebops	The ██████████ actually CAN sing.
SarahBrown	training	Deedee	██████ has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do NOT lip sing.
SarahBrown	training	von Trotta	While Ms. ██████████ shows that the courage of a small number of Germans made a difference, she does not use it to excuse German society.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	████ comes from an aristocratic German family and her brother, recently returned from Stalingrad, is a Wehrmacht officer.
SarahBrown	training	Fabian	"After being refused help from her father to free ██████ she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow Officer, ""I know what they do to the Jews."
SarahBrown	training	Joseph Goebbels	Given his support, she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the Minister of Culture, ███████████████, a known womanizer.
SarahBrown	training	Goebbels	While this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters, it is a historical fact that ████████ was very active in making the decisions affecting Rosenstrasse.
SarahBrown	training	Margarethe von Trotta	The director █████████████████████, an activist, feminist, and intellectual, is no stranger to political drama.
SarahBrown	training	von Trotta	Now ██████████ has shown the opposite to be true, that something could be done to resist the Nazis.
SarahBrown	training	John McIntyre	█████████████ does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge/entrepreneur/thief.
SarahBrown	training	Walter Brennan	██████████████ does basically the same role he did in Red River years earlier.
SarahBrown	training	James Stewart	And, in my opinion, █████████████ gives as fine a performance as he ever did.
SarahBrown	training	Grant	While this makes it pretty different from the average █████ film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining.
SarahBrown	training	Cary	"It's sort of like someone said ""let's just follow ████ around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed""."
SarahBrown	training	Cary Grant	It's a great film for ██████████ fans or for the whole family.
SarahBrown	training	Andy Stitzer	████████████ has a peaceful life.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	One day, while playing poker with his friends of his work, they discover that ████ is in fact...virgin!
SarahBrown	training	Neil Simon	A hilarious ██████████ comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end.
SarahBrown	training	graham	I've got coconut, pineapple and ██████.
SarahBrown	training	graham	I got coconut, pineapple and ██████.
SarahBrown	training	- John Ulmer	████████████
SarahBrown	training	Bette Davis's	Interesting in that █████████████ plot line is essentially back story!
SarahBrown	training	Señor Lopez	¡Gracias, ███████████!
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	I have seen all the films directed by ██████████████ and appreciated his love of the American people and the land.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	███████'s cast is perfect.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	What makes these relationships special however, is the attention ███████ gives to the language as spoken in dialogue.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in ███████'s directorial hands.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	Given the material, ███████'s ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.
SarahBrown	training	Lillian Hellman	███████████████, one of America's most famous women playwrights, was a woman with a mission.
SarahBrown	training	Hellman	In it Ms. ███████ was heralding America's entrance in World War II.
SarahBrown	training	Herman Shumlin	As directed for the screen by ██████████████, the film was well received when it premiered in 1943.
SarahBrown	training	Muller	We are introduced to the ██████ family, when the film opens.
SarahBrown	training	Muller	We find out that Mr. ██████ has had a terrible time in his native land, as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing Fascim.
SarahBrown	training	Bette Davis'	It is a curiosity piece because of ████████████ supporting role.
SarahBrown	training	Zentropa	████████ is the most original movie I've seen in years.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier's	███████████ follow-ups like Breaking the Waves have gotten more acclaim, but this is really his best work.
SarahBrown	training	Paul F. Ryan's	This is ██████████████ first and only full-length feature.
SarahBrown	training	Ryan	"I don't know when or why the idea emerged in his head, but ████ wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie, ""Home room""."
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	Busy Philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as ██████, a troubled girl; the ones we always see in television series.
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	He is helping all the students to recover from the event, but ██████ doesn't seem to care.
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	So the Principal punishes her; she needs to visit ██████ every day until five o' clock.
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	██████ seems naive and with plain thoughts; no complexity inside of her mind.
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	"When ██████ enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks: ""Who has brought them?""."
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	"""Many people"", ██████ answers; although some days later we learn they're from her parents, who come every week."
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	██████ is lonely.
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	██████ seems mature and violent; smoking cigarettes and talking roughly.
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	But after two days of visiting, she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day; even sleeping in ██████'s room all night.
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	"When they both have a fight afterwards, I believe ██████ says: ""Why do you keep coming back?""."
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	██████ is lonely too.
SarahBrown	training	Erika Christensen	When it comes to █████████████████, this was the role she needed to fly higher.
SarahBrown	training	Philipps	On the other hand, Busy ████████, who proved to be very promising in this movie (what a transformation), hasn't got many opportunities for other roles.
SarahBrown	training	Paul F. Ryan	The same I say about ████████████ (in directing, of curse), and I expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script; I'm waiting for his next movie.
SarahBrown	training	mother(Diane Keaton	A single ███████████████████) finds herself working several minimum-wage jobs.
SarahBrown	training	Diane Keaton	████████████ overacts a lot, and her character comes off as crazy but she was extremely convincing.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Seater	However, the best performance in the movie comes from ██████████████, who plays her oldest son.
SarahBrown	training	Colin Roberts	█████████████, who plays the younger son, also does a great job.
SarahBrown	training	Suspense	It Was A Very Interesting Movie,Filled With Drama And ████████,From The Beginning To The Very End.
SarahBrown	training	Terry Gilliam	Probably a bit much for normal American kids, and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film, this movie reminded me a quite a bit of Time Bandits - very █████████████ all the way through.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	And while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of █████'s work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn poignant.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	F'n rad, and one of █████'s best!
SarahBrown	training	Jess	Old ████ could make 'em when he tried.
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter	But with ███████████ in it i felt that it had a little potential in it, plus their was something else with it I liked.
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter	The acting was great, not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines, ███████████ always brings his A game when it comes to comedy .
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter	My father who never watches sitcoms at all, he just watches movies, sports, and law & order, he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother, and myself, and watched the show I think because ███████████ was in it.
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter God	I honestly think this show would still be running if ███████████████ rest his soul i wish he hadn't passed away.
SarahBrown	training	Barbara Bouchet	To begin with, it's hard to go wrong with ███████████████ and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo.
SarahBrown	training	Bouchet	Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent ███████ as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life.
SarahBrown	training	Red Queen	In fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing █████████ running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film.
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Nicolai's	Finally, ███████████████ score may be the best I've heard from the composer.
SarahBrown	training	Gialli	If you've seen more than a couple ██████, you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings.
SarahBrown	training	Kern	The music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it's so perfectly styled in the early 20th Century idiom that was ████'s original period.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	"Probably the most memorable performance in the film is █████'s dance to the ""Alter-Ego Dance"", which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience."
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	Fans will want to seek this out for various reasons -- █████ fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of MGM with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his usual MGM material.
SarahBrown	training	Rita	Hayworth fans will want to see ████ in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability.
SarahBrown	training	Jason Bourne	After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if ██████ can head them off.
SarahBrown	training	Bobby Earl	As he digs further and further into the mysterious case he realizes that ██████████ is a victim of discrimination.
SarahBrown	training	Tanny Brown	That the black police detective Lt.███████████ of the small community is corrupt and villainously mean.
SarahBrown	training	Blair Sullivan	When the infamous,psychotic serial killer ██████████████ is introduced.
SarahBrown	training	Bobby Earl	██████████ gets a re-trial.
SarahBrown	training	Sullivan	All seems swimmingly well until an unexpected phone call from serial killer ████████ comes into focus.
SarahBrown	training	Sullivan	He just merely struck a bargain with fiendish psycho ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Armstrong	Upon █████████'s beautiful wife and daughter.
SarahBrown	training	Sullivan	Now ████████ is executed to his death.
SarahBrown	training	Brown	But good,virtuous cop █████ emerges and thwarts the brutal baddie.
SarahBrown	training	Sean Connery	████████████ is great as the oblivious,holier than thou hero.
SarahBrown	training	Laurence Fishburne	██████████████████ is watchably amazing as the mean,arrogant,but good guy cop.
SarahBrown	training	Capeshaw	████████ is okay.
SarahBrown	training	Ruby Dee	████████ is great as the tenacious grandmother.
SarahBrown	training	Coleen Camp	I thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches, the cast (especially ███████████) is perfect and the Big Bad Apple never looked better on film.
SarahBrown	training	Franks	This stand-out scary episode is given a substantial disturbing boost by the exceptional acting from gifted child actress ██████, who projects a truly unsettling sense of serene evil lurking just underneath a deceptively sweet and innocent angelic veneer.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	"Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, ████████████ gives us a rousing finish of the ""Star Wars"" saga in ""Jedi""."
SarahBrown	training	Film Summary	████████████ (Contains Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Seen It)
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	███████████, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it's construction.
SarahBrown	training	Luke Skywalker	The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring young ██████████████ to the Dark Side.
SarahBrown	training	Lando	While █████ heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star's shield generator on the Forest Moon Of Endor.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	During the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as ████ willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side.
SarahBrown	training	Maurice Richard	It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture, to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed, and ate everything ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Roch Carrier	I thought it was brilliant to have ████████████ narrate this story.
SarahBrown	training	Maurice Richard va toujours	███████████████████████████ vivre dans nos coeurs.
SarahBrown	training	Pacino	Mr. ██████ once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy.
SarahBrown	training	John Pappas	As New York Mayor ███████████ in City Hall.
SarahBrown	training	John Cusack	That the other NYC locations provide the vivid settings as an idealistic mayoral aide (███████████) follows a trail of subversion and cover-up that may loop back to the man he serves and reveres.
SarahBrown	training	Personnaly	██████████, I never run over such a twist-off story in real life.
SarahBrown	training	Sandu	"I think this line of Kiki to █████ says all: ""I want to stop...and if you love me, you will do as I ask you""."
SarahBrown	training	Dee Dee	The band, ███████ especially, always disliked the movie through the 80's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into Ramones shows.
SarahBrown	training	Elmer Fudd	Just watched this early Bugs Bunny (first time he's named here) and ██████████ cartoon on the ThadBlog as linked from YouTube.
SarahBrown	training	Elmer	whenever █████ catches him in his bed.
SarahBrown	training	Nanavati	████████ did a great job putting this short together.
SarahBrown	training	Don Bluth's	I hadn't heard much about it since then, nor did I really remember anything about it, it having been forgotten in the wake of ███████████ other, probably better films.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	█████, it seemed, was the fifth-most important person in the cast.
SarahBrown	training	Hammond	I don't know whether it's because ███████ was more important that I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to ****.
SarahBrown	training	Don S. Davis	EDIT on 7-18-08: I just found out that ████████████ died a few weeks ago.
SarahBrown	training	Kerry	"But the other shows were awesome; █████ was my favorite character, because she was in ""the dark side."""
SarahBrown	training	Bridget	I also thought that ███████ was funny because she was all perky.
SarahBrown	training	Kyle	I also thought that guy who played ████ was really, really cute.
SarahBrown	training	Kerry	I loved it when █████ made sarcastic remarks about everything.
SarahBrown	training	Donna Summer	"Even the main song of the movie (""On the Radio"" by ████████████) was a big hit before this came out."
SarahBrown	training	Foster	The acting is good on all counts with ██████ giving the best performance.
SarahBrown	training	Kellerman	The relationship between her and █████████ (who was excellent) was realistic and well-done.
SarahBrown	training	Scott Baio	Even ██████████ (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) more or less realistically played a teen boy.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	"God, bless ""Bend it like ███████"" I believe it is a true gem."
SarahBrown	training	Powell	Pressburger and ██████'s greatest movie.
SarahBrown	training	David Niven	███████████ plays the RAF bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is AWOL and dispatches an angel to investigate.
SarahBrown	training	Emilio Miraglio's	"█████████████████ ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed."
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Nicolai	Another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy, hummable score, and █████████████ provides one for this film that should stay with you for days.
SarahBrown	training	Ugo Pagliai	Well, I'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings, shootings, impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out...not to mention the crypts, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and LOTS of 'em, too!), the drug references, a rape scene, the obligatory red herrings and, in the person of ███████████, a hunky leading man for the female viewers.
SarahBrown	training	swan	A story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely ████ whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks'	Hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach, for example, is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs ██████████████ dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance.
SarahBrown	training	Sergei Eisenstein	In a way, this is an experiment of a movie, and closer to the style of █████████████████ in visual presentation and near-intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	█████████████ here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for: she's a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend.
SarahBrown	training	Hitchcock	This final sequence looks like something straight out of █████████ in its heightened suspense (seen in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH) and cuts from Brooks, her image on screen, and the murderous boyfriend.
SarahBrown	training	Brooks	"Even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing ""live"" ██████ with the now dead one -- a chilling effect to a chilling, powerful movie."
SarahBrown	training	Emilio P. Miraglia	"Directed by ██████████████████ who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting ""La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba"" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences."
SarahBrown	training	Sette Volte	"A convincing Giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings, ""La Dama Rossa Uccide ███████████"" is highly recommended to Giallo fans and slightly superior to Miraglia's above mentioned other thriller."
SarahBrown	training	Walter Reed	The ███████████ scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Bloch	This film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film (along the lines of Tales from the Crypt) written by ████████████ (author of Psycho).
SarahBrown	training	Jon Pertwee	Who fans since ███████████ (the third Doctor) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star!
SarahBrown	training	George E. Carey	"In any case, ███████████████ who wrote, produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much (of a wayward married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulation; and, a little help - of course) that he wrote, produced and starred in ""Weekend with the Babysitter."""
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	It's quite hard to see how a sound version could have been created, since it is shot with pure silent technique, long wordless sweeps of narrative without a single intertitle -- save for a few disconcerting sequences where █████████████, playing a French typist, is quite visibly speaking in English...
SarahBrown	training	Brooks	The only section that obviously cries out for sound is the final scene, where ██████ is watching the rushes for her test 'for a sound film': footage which plays constantly in the background as the action unfolds, with her mouth moving in ceaseless soundless song.
SarahBrown	training	Murnau	"In many ways ""Prix de Beauté"" reminds me of ██████'s ""Sunrise""."
SarahBrown	training	André	Gossip columns confirm all █████'s worst convictions, as he learns of his wife's whereabouts through reports coupling her name with Grabovsky.
SarahBrown	training	Lucienne	He kills her, but even as he kills is transfixed by the living image on screen, ████████ in all her transformed glory as he never saw her.
SarahBrown	training	André	The two women are juxtaposed in an endless, powerful moment, as █████ is seen, seized, unresisting, and pulled away: the dying girl and her singing self still projected above, caught unknowing out of time into celluloid eternity, playing on unconscious of life or death or love beneath her...
SarahBrown	training	Will Smith	"Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring ██████████."
SarahBrown	training	Burt	Thank You for the reunion Adam and ████.
SarahBrown	training	Blake Edwards	█████████████ certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	The film soars and swirls (aerial photography; █████████████ in motion) and captivates.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	One must just buy into the premise that █████████████ is a spy whose mission has gone wrong.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews'	██████████████ belting out of war songs and the haunting 'Whistling Away the Dark' are reason enough to turn the TV on, just for the soundtrack.
SarahBrown	training	Jenny	And the striptease number, like the '█████' number in Star! works.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews'	These are both interesting pieces of ██████████████ meticulous and then underrated works.
SarahBrown	training	Sandler	███████ frequently talks to the camera and the film does not take itself seriously, but that is all part of the fun!
SarahBrown	training	Artemisia	Cervi portrays █████████ so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place.
SarahBrown	training	Artemisia	The passion to which █████████ gives to her art is just spectacular to watch.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	Having some knowledge of Lacanian psycho-analysis helps (Symbolic, Real, and Imaginary) are terms which get thrown around a little loosely at first, but the scenes which █████ selects and analyze make remarkably clear what was always for me, a very abstract subject.
SarahBrown	training	David Lynch	"Why is ""The Sound Of Music"" kinda fascistic, why is ""Short Cuts"" about more than just class and alienation, why do the birds attack in ""The Birds"", what is there to learn about the mind from ""Alien Resurrection"", what does the planet of ""Solaris"" want, what does ""Psycho"" and ""The Marx Brothers"" have to do with each other, and what the hell is ███████████ getting across in movie after movie..."
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	well █████ has some ideas.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	"The role of the voice in both ""The Excorcist"" and ""Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith"", is maybe the movies strongest and most lucid moment, when he gets into feminine sexual subjectivity I begin to wonder...at one point █████ admits his feeling that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentatta, that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children (jokingly, it seems"
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	"█████ claims cinema is the ultimate pervert art, because it teaches ""how to desire, and not what to desire"", and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow for these desires to be articulated."
SarahBrown	training	Tawa	This tale set in Wellington, New Zealand suburbia (████ -home of the renowned Tawa College) is McCarten's first feature.
SarahBrown	training	Brigham Young	I enjoyed watching █████████████ and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the LDS faith.
SarahBrown	training	Brigham	Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality, both ███████ and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church.
SarahBrown	training	Brigham	Whether or not you believe this statement or not, just know that the film does not accurately portray what ███████ himself believed.
SarahBrown	training	Ricky Ullman	and ████████████ was absolutely true to his role for a Disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should see.
SarahBrown	training	Gruver	I think that Mr ██████ would have been so proud to have such a submission in his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again.
SarahBrown	training	Sandra Bernhard	███████████████ is quite a character, and certainly one of the funniest women on earth.
SarahBrown	training	Madonna	It's an adaptation of her smash-hit off-Broadway show which made her a superstar  and ███████'s best friend for about four years.
SarahBrown	training	Bernhard	If you are a ████████ fan, you can't miss out this film; it's a tribute as well to her (weird) beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne.
SarahBrown	training	Hedwig	"And it has influenced filmmakers in their work  ""██████ and the Angry Inch"", for instance, would look a lot different if ""Without You I'm Nothing"" didn't exist."
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte Manning	The cast includes many veteran players, as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as █████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Miike Takashi	One of director █████████████'s very best.
SarahBrown	training	Yubari	You name it, it's there: a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy/dysfunctional world into another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; a beautiful heroine he has a crush on; a sadistic henchwoman (Go-Go ██████ from Kill Bill Vol. 1); a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best ██████████ movie, but this a pretty good one.
SarahBrown	training	Gene	I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how ████ got the girl.
SarahBrown	training	Gene	My favorite part though without a doubt is ████'s dance with his alter ego.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly's	I love watching two ████████████ for the price of one.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	It shows what talent Mr. █████ really was.
SarahBrown	training	a Gene Kelly	I'm sure that everyone out there has ████████████ friend that has this movie in their collection.
SarahBrown	training	David Kelly	The only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by ███████████).
SarahBrown	training	Ben Barnes	One day a young man from Wall named ██████████ out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech.
SarahBrown	training	Stormhold	He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called █████████ where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	While the witch is away, Una seduces ███ and sends him on his way.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	███ returns to Wall without incident and continues his life.
SarahBrown	training	Lamia	But he must get past the princes and █████ first.
SarahBrown	training	Robert DeNiro	 But Tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother (though he doesn't know it's his mother) and a band of flying pirates led by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	DeNiro	His is the most important character in the movie and ██████ plays it to a tee.
SarahBrown	training	DeNiro	Though his role is small in length, ██████ is extraordinary!
SarahBrown	training	Matthew Vaughn	"Moreover director ██████████████, whose only other directing experience was ""Layer Cake"", weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy."
SarahBrown	training	Zukovic	I was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings, especially when you think that this is ███████'s first large scale attempt.
SarahBrown	training	Gary Cooper	███████████ is at his most taciturn, but manages some occasional pithy sayings: 'The plains are big, but trails cross ... sometimes.'
SarahBrown	training	Jesse James	All the cowboy heroes of Western lore seem to be in there somehow except for ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Eisenhower	A remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what ██████████ was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex'.
SarahBrown	training	DeMille	But let's not get into politics, let's leave that to ███████, who can be guaranteed to be superficial.
SarahBrown	training	George Antheil	The chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by ██████████████, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, 'Bad Boy of Music'.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Quinn	It is amusing to see █████████████ in an early appearance as a Cheyenne Indian.
SarahBrown	training	Gabby Hayes	███████████ is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd.
SarahBrown	training	Gary Cooper	███████████ overtops them all, looming large, - but when did he ever loom small?
SarahBrown	training	Mitchum	███████'s regression from soft-spoken stranger to deranged murderer, with a host of dark emotions in between, is a marvel of expressive, physical acting.
SarahBrown	training	Pearl	I got hooked on this as apparently ABC has licensed this show to █████ TV in Hong Kong.
SarahBrown	training	Damien	Nothing too unbelievable, though I think it's very very stereotypical of them to write ██████ as a potential black man with a sheet!!!!
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Bacon	███████████ proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way.
SarahBrown	training	Caine	But when his team is unable to bring back into visibility, █████ is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge...*end spoilers*
SarahBrown	training	Scarlett Johansson	Continuing in concept where Paris, Je T'aime had begun in spawning the City of Love Franchise (Shanghai will be next, so says the end of the closing credits here), the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme, although someone probably forgot to tell ██████████████████ some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules, and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well, it was shot in black and white), but here's hoping that it would make it to the DVD at least.
SarahBrown	training	Highlander	I prefer this movie than other movie such The cell ( sick movie ) and ██████████ ( silly movie ).
SarahBrown	training	Gina	████ was a complex character.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Weber	"████████████, most notably from the sitcom ""Wings"", did a nice job as the quiet, meek, underachieving sociopath."
SarahBrown	training	Weber	█████ really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys.
SarahBrown	training	Peckinpah	Manr regard █████████'s RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY as one of the first and best later western, which had a realistic look at life in the old west, but the hardly known LAST HUNT is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier.
SarahBrown	training	Taylor	When the camera moves on and away from Mr. ██████ a white buffalo skin comes into sight (on a tree)and echos from the past, when all the hatred began, are present again.
SarahBrown	training	Taylor	Mr. ██████ has got his buffalo, but in the end the buffalo got him.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Mann	 Aside from the top performances of everybody involved, the intelligent script and the great dialogue, it should also be mentioned, that THE LAST HUNT is superbly photograped, I have seldomely seen a western that well shot (aside from the ones directed by ████████████, which are also all superbly photographed), that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well.
SarahBrown	training	BROOKS	And director ██████ is really a superb storyteller.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries	████████████████████████████████ spoof is also very amusing.
SarahBrown	training	Kim Hunter	He meets and falls in love with lovely June (██████████).
SarahBrown	training	Niven	There's also a very strange sequence when █████ runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep!
SarahBrown	training	Courtney	This film has its detractors, and ████████'s fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant.
SarahBrown	training	Finney	██████, naturally, is larger than life.
SarahBrown	training	Courtney	████████ makes an ideal foil.
SarahBrown	training	Courtney	I thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads, and ████████'s character provides plenty of dark humor.
SarahBrown	training	Loy	 Not one of Grant's nor ███'s best films, they make an outstanding effort together.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	I have to admit that █████████ is one of a kind, you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark's	From this new millenium update, we could see ███████████ vision of the Zu mountains.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark's	"It may have a thin story, but hey look at ███████████ ""Time & Tide,"" we got confused by the plot as well, but it was truly something stylish and awesome."
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	█████████ always attracts something different into H.K. Cinema.
SarahBrown	training	PJ Soles	████████ stars as Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	Meanwhile the school that Riff attends, has just hired a brand-new Principal, named Ms. █████.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	Ms. █████ is especially determined to nab Riff, and put a stop to Riff's anarchic shenanigans.
SarahBrown	training	Mary	████ is a legendary B movie actress.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	And in this film, she plays the fascist Ms. █████, with sneering relish.
SarahBrown	training	PJ Soles	████████ as Riff, turns in an electrifying performance.
SarahBrown	training	Clint Howard	████████████ as the duplicitous Eaglebauer, has lots of fun with his role.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save ████, thereby risking his own life !
SarahBrown	training	Yoda	The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot  By the way, if you enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and ████, then you should read a few books about Buddhism and the forms it took in Ancient Japan.
SarahBrown	training	Ben Gazzara	He shoots her in loving close-ups, gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled ███████████, and allows her room to sparkle throughout.
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter's	The love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing, though I did tire of █████████████ TV-styled klutziness.
SarahBrown	training	Hepburn	But it's really ███████'s valentine and she absolutely glows.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Brosnan	So, ██████████████, the Irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-smoking, sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis.
SarahBrown	training	Greg Kinnear	He meets a struggling businessman, ████████████, and after a rocky beginning, he learns that he needs a friend.
SarahBrown	training	Philip Baker Hall	Add character actor, █████████████████ as the hit-man's manager and we're off to the races.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Downey Jr.	I mean, how can you have a bad movie with █████████████████ in it,none have and ever will exist.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Verhoeven	"██████████████ (genius and master film maker) strikes back with the less than perfect, yet still fun in a ""dirty old man type of way,"" Hollow Man."
SarahBrown	training	Josh Brolin	Two major flaws: ███████████ (aka walking ape-man) and the whole deal with the elevator.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Harling	The script by playwright ██████████████ is packed with one liners and ridiculous situations.
SarahBrown	training	Keven Kline's	█████████████ murdering of his lines, due to not wearing his glasses, is hilarious.
SarahBrown	training	Kline	The brilliant cast is on the same page as █████.
SarahBrown	training	Alan Silvestri	The score by ██████████████ is an added bonus.
SarahBrown	training	Fred MacMurray	"Co star ██████████████ is probably best known for ""Double Indemnity"", with Stanwyck, as well as his hit TV show ""My Three Sons""."
SarahBrown	training	Maggie	"In ""Swing High"", ██████ the tourist meets a soldier who is leaving the army."
SarahBrown	training	Maggie	██████ misses her boat when it leaves port and gets tangled up with the soldier.
SarahBrown	training	Lamour	Some good singing by ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Cecil Cunningham	"Good (but brief) acting performance by ████████████████ as ""Murph"", the wise, helpful owner of the local saloon in Panama."
SarahBrown	training	Smallville	It's my favorite episode of ██████████! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
SarahBrown	training	Truman Capote	The story was written by █████████████, so you get the very Liberal anti-death penalty message at the end of the film, which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	My third viewing of this film came in early April of 2005, shortly after █████, in real life, was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	One can't help but look at █████ and this film differently after that.
SarahBrown	training	Olan	Her character ████ is a shy and timid woman, with inner strength.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Muni	█████████ shows that he can act as well.
SarahBrown	training	Ms Hawn	A pretty average movie but a brave one from ███████ to promote this vehicle as Exec Producer & as a starring vehicle.
SarahBrown	training	Goldie	██████ surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona & ventures in projects other won't.
SarahBrown	training	Harry Potter	The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, ████████████ and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	Stardust, based on a novel by ███████████, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The ██████ Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see ████████, and I loved it.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Bloch	Four great stories from master ████████████, adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early Seventies, are the base of this excellent Amicus' production.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Lee	This one in particular shines for the episode Sweets to the Sweet, where ███████████████ is stalked by his evil little girl child, heiress to her mother tradition.
SarahBrown	training	Ingrid Pitt	Great fun from start to finish, and good to very good are also the other three episodes (with the last one a bit on the comic side, but with the great addition of ███████████, the most famous vampress of the English cinema.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	it's hard to say what, what button █████ has found and boldly pressed, but it works.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into █████'s lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.
SarahBrown	training	Blockbuster	Just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time, picked it up one night previously viewed at ███████████ and absolutely loved it, I've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well.
SarahBrown	training	Paul F. Ryan	"Avoid of all the Hollywood glamour, special effects and stress on the ""shock factor"", this independent film by ████████████ hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations."
SarahBrown	training	Ryan	████ pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche.
SarahBrown	training	Dawn Marie Wellesley	"Overall, I recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it, I also suggest the documentary ""It's a Girls World"" put out by CBC in 2004, which deals with the topic of social bullying, comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of ████████████████████ a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied."
SarahBrown	training	Adam Jones	"The film ""Cross Eyed"" by ██████████ propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order."
SarahBrown	training	Adam Jones	██████████ has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most.
SarahBrown	training	Jones	It is only a matter of time before █████ strikes again.
SarahBrown	training	Trent Harris	I was lucky enough to catch it, along with a Q&A session with director ████████████, at the NY Video Festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of Trent's website.
SarahBrown	training	Sean Penn	After having seen the TRILOGY a few times, I do have to admit that I could probably do without the █████████ version.
SarahBrown	training	Crispin Glover	"It's like a try-out version for the ██████████████ ""Orkly Kid"" section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you're a Penn fan than it being a good video."
SarahBrown	training	Gary	Once you see this film, you'll never get ████'s nervous laughter out of your head ever again.
SarahBrown	training	McBain	"I guess ""██████"" will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure, because there's no way I can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture."
SarahBrown	training	Roberto Santos	 Vietnam POW McBain's life is saved by fellow soldier ██████████████ on the very last day of the war.
SarahBrown	training	Santos	Eighteen years later, ██████ is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country Columbia.
SarahBrown	training	Santos	██████ initial attempt to take over the power fails and he's publicly executed on El Presidente's balcony.
SarahBrown	training	McBain	His sister travels to New York with the dollar note and turns to ██████ for financial assistance and manpower.
SarahBrown	training	McBain	██████ and his former Vietnam buddies, who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world, charter themselves a miserable little plane and fly to Columbia to open a gigantic can of whoop-ass.
SarahBrown	training	McBain	"The fact you're reading a user- comment on ""██████"" already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low-budget B-movie action."
SarahBrown	training	McBain	"One of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of ""██████""."
SarahBrown	training	Joan Baez	"This particular motion picture relies on the ruff 'n tuff acting performances of the macho leads, a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which █████████ sings a cover of ""Brothers in Arms""."
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	Karloff's was definitely the lead role, but ██████ acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person--something he didn't play very often in films!!
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	But, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that ████ discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine (don't you hate it when that happens?).
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	While this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story, the plot was well constructed, the characters nicely developed and the mad ████ was NOT a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting.
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard's	Having written over five hundred reviews, I have never found myself at such a loss of words as I did with director █████████████████ subtle, yet inspirational love story.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	As a viewer, you are pulled in instantly by Emmanuelle Devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named █████, whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty.
SarahBrown	training	Devos	█████' solemn and homely look is breathtaking, as she changes her image for Paul; the truth of her beauty is discovered.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	████, the wildcard in the film, continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Then, just as we assume one, █████ takes on one last shape.
SarahBrown	training	Audiard	The interwoven stories seem unconnected at first, but ███████ lets them connect bit by bit.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	A favorite scene is when █████ is attempting to discover where some money is being held.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	When a discovery is made in Paul's apartment by █████, I found myself deeply angry.
SarahBrown	training	Warfield	████████ lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	I have seen this movie a while back, after ordering it for my friend, who is a big ████████████████ fan.
SarahBrown	training	Donnie Darko	"The movie itself was very interesting, though it had its positive points, which for me was the ████████████ kind of ""wtf?"" factor after the movie had ended."
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	To me, the young girl in the film was incredibly good, and ████████████████ did a good job as well.
SarahBrown	training	Bandes Dessinées	"Who doesn't know Largo Winch in the France-Belgium-Luxemburg trio (the three countries where the French ""BD"" or ""████████████████"" are massively published) ?"
SarahBrown	training	Jim	███, AKA Kid Wichita, has a way of making things happen, only trouble is, he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been.
SarahBrown	training	John Barrymore Jr.	The opening credits state 'Introducing ██████████████████ as the Younger Brother', in this his very first screen appearance.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff	That seemed rather odd to me, particularly since he was addressed as ████ almost immediately into the story.
SarahBrown	training	Sean Penn	Approximately eighteen at the time of this movie, he bears a passing resemblance to █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Drew Barrymore	No stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family, I was left wondering if his daughter ██████████████ might have ever seen this picture.
SarahBrown	training	George Kerby	Knowing Sterling previously only from his role as ████████████ in the early 1950's TV series 'Topper', I thought he looked out of place in a Western, but that might just be me.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Lukas	██████████ plays the very earnest and decent head of his family.
SarahBrown	training	Bette Davis	███████████ is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time.
SarahBrown	training	Bette Davis	About the only ones who sounded real were ███████████ and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).
SarahBrown	training	Dashiel Hammett	It's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous ███████████████ wrote this dialog, as it just doesn't sound true to life.
SarahBrown	training	Lillian Hellman	The story was based on the play by his lover, ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Gackt	"The shooting scenes are ridiculous though, and I think █████ (who wrote the book) takes a little bit too much of his ""Matrix obsession"" into it."
SarahBrown	training	Gackt	█████ is a superb actor I must say..he shows so much emotion.
SarahBrown	training	Hyde	This was ████'s first time acting and he did okay.
SarahBrown	training	Wang Lee Hom	████████████ is absolutely great.
SarahBrown	training	Sunny Davis	It's an interesting adventure with the life of ███████████, who is arranged to marry the king of Ohtar, so that the U.S. can get an army base there to balance power in the Middle East.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	The story of █████████ has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	What ensures █████████ has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	The more the stories try to portray █████ as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	Which is where this adaptation of Our Sunshine, a novel about the █████ legend, excels.
SarahBrown	training	a Ned Kelly	Rather than attempting to portray ███████████ who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	Here, █████████ is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	While the █████ gang were distinctly Irish, Australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this).
SarahBrown	training	Heath Ledger	████████████ does an amazing job of impersonating Australia's most notorious outlaw.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	If one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that █████████ becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at Glenrowan.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	Annoyingly, the trial and execution of █████████ is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	That said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, █████████ manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly's	Especially if you want a more factual account of ███████████ life.
SarahBrown	training	David	█████ want's to know if it's all aborigine folklore or there's some scientific facts, or logic, behind their end of world-like revelations.
SarahBrown	training	David	 The stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that █████'s been seeing in both his night-time dreams and day-time visions.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some ████.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher's	████████████████ story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children.
SarahBrown	training	Iris	'Stanley and ████' show the triumph of the human spirit.
SarahBrown	training	William Castle	The series was a colossal disappointment--even with ██████████████ as exec.
SarahBrown	training	Ghost Story	If, however,you have a chance to see the original TV movie, ███████████, check it out.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dance	█████████████ makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	"I have never been much of an ████████████ fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner: a bit of ""Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass""."
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte Lewis	███████████████ is, to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable, luminously gorgeous.
SarahBrown	training	Jean-Pierre Marielle	_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of ████████████████████ desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be, but a stunning tribute to French actors and their cinema.
SarahBrown	training	Xica	The only thing I would have changed is the end for ████ and her long life love.
SarahBrown	training	Xica	████ has been by far, the best soap I have ever seen.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	However, Veronika does not forget █████, and keeps waiting for him.
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	The scenes of ████████ in the middle of the tanks, or in the train station with many figurants are awesome.
SarahBrown	training	Cary Grant	Filled with great characters all of whom, ██████████ is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home.
SarahBrown	training	La Maman et	███████████ la Putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects.
SarahBrown	training	Françoise Lebrun	The very long monologue spoken by ████████████████ is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood, manhood and love.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Pierre Léaud	And IMHO, █████████████████ is one of the greatest French actors.
SarahBrown	training	Emory	█████ is a Cincinatti steel worker like his father before him and for most of the 20th century the twin pillars of his family's existence have been the steel mill and the union.
SarahBrown	training	Emory	"At first, newly-unemployed █████ and his pals enjoy their independence, hanging out around town and carousing at their favorite bar, where they down ""depth charges"" with reckless abandon."
SarahBrown	training	Emory	█████'s father - a dedicated union man - is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short-lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill.
SarahBrown	training	Emory	 Finally the union admits its helplessness, as █████ explains to his stubborn father that times have changed and that the mill won't ever open again.
SarahBrown	training	Emory	"█████ tearfully asks ""What did I do wrong?"""
SarahBrown	training	Emory	Tossed out of his own home and stinging from the plant manager's comments that he and his men didn't work hard enough to justify their substantial paychecks, █████ recruits the steel workers still left in town to do something that will demonstrate to all what they are capable of.
SarahBrown	training	Emory	"The manager asks █████: ""Can you do this every day?"""
SarahBrown	training	Emory	"█████ is forced to nod ""No"" and the manager asks: ""Then what were you trying to prove?"""
SarahBrown	training	Emory	"█████ explains that the workers' decades of hard work, honesty and devotion to their jobs had meaning and that by showing how much they could produce in one day ""We just spit in your eye."""
SarahBrown	training	Emory	█████ bids a tearful farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south, promising to relocate the family when he finds it.
SarahBrown	training	lau kar leung	sammo takes on █████████████ in a casino, sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in.
SarahBrown	training	lam ching ying	some great and touching moments in the film, ██████████████ pops up in a cameo and gets killed off - gutted.
SarahBrown	training	billy chow	sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Kaif Bhopali	Rafi, the lyrics by ████████████ and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars.
SarahBrown	training	Raj Kumar	But one actor who didn't change in his looks was the late █████████, who falls in love with her and especially her feet, after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them, he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are.
SarahBrown	training	Pakeezah	Conclusion: ████████ is a beautiful romantic story that, if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs.
SarahBrown	training	Kamal Amrohi's	██████████████ grandson has now started to revive his grand father's studio by making a comedy movie.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Cassel	When they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult, but, when the first applicant is ex-con Paul (██████████████) she seizes the chance to change her life.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	█████ covers his mistakes and he, anxious to go straight, reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagues.
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard's	"French filmmaker █████████████████ third feature ""Read My Lips"" is a genre-defying piece, switching from dark social comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller."
SarahBrown	training	Joseph Schildkraut	"██████████████████ as the womanising arrogant ""Vadas"" - so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning."
SarahBrown	training	Timon	"While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), █████ and Pumbaa have an argument of what point of ""The Lion King"" they are going to start watching, as Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning."
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre █████████'s Day cards.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	█████████ is almost a comedy/horror.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on █████████'s Day.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for █████████'s extravagant lampooning.
SarahBrown	training	Dylan Sellers	"Lest some think I'm ""reading too much"" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he ""didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend"" and producer █████████████ said he wanted to do something ""more adult""."
SarahBrown	training	Redford	"We have videos of many of ███████ s movies and we have watched ""A River runs through it"" many times."
SarahBrown	training	Redford	"███████ is part of the ""famdamily"" as he is always around."
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. ███████'s father.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	I love the scene where ██████ and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer!
SarahBrown	training	Brad Pitt	"Then as adult Paul played by █████████ (Se7ven) is the ""perfect guy"" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it."
SarahBrown	training	Neal Burns	The same applies to ██████████, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	███████ himself does a superb job as a narrator.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects, to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as ███████ because I have had the chance to see his works.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	███████ needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	███████ shows the hands of the Creator so magnificently and a river runs through it.
SarahBrown	training	Delirious	The first time I came upon █████████, I only heard it.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	█████'s ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is captivating.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	There will be no other comedian like █████.
SarahBrown	training	Pereira dos Santos	The cannibalism is as scarce of desire as the full-frontal nudity of the cast, suggested in lieu as the representative core of ██████████████████'s dry political cartoon of New World mythology and undeveloped social coherence.
SarahBrown	training	Saura	█████ encompasses all Spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	One day ████ doesn't know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows.
SarahBrown	training	Janeway	The fact that Adm. ███████ was able to do a double switch on the Borg was great.
SarahBrown	training	Lillard	The suspense of wondering what ███████ was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell	We have known ████████████, as, in my opinion, one of the best scene thieves of all time.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	Its gut-busting attitude will have you laughing the whole time through, while we simultaneously see the real life struggles of people like ████ and his fellow co-workers.
SarahBrown	training	Carell	She was cast perfected in the role and her and ██████ have terrific, not to mention, hilarious chemistry on screen.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell	 Overall, ████████████ gives one of the funniest performances I've ever seen and just about everyone in the cast distributes to the non-stop laughter.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell	████████████ is a huge star.
SarahBrown	training	Eliason A.	My Rating: 9/10  Objectively  9/10  Subjectively  10/10  ██████████
SarahBrown	training	De Niro	Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially ███████, who is awesome).
SarahBrown	training	Jon Bon Jovi	████████████ was a drawback initially, but he proved to be a half-way decent Slayer.
SarahBrown	training	James Wood's	I doubt anyone could top ████████████ performance in the first one, though... unless you bring in Buffy!
SarahBrown	training	Derek Bliss	I was left with two questions, though... what happened to Jack Crow & how did ███████████ come to be a slayer?
SarahBrown	training	Graham Greene	Good old black and white █████████████ based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things.
SarahBrown	training	Boyer	Bacall lights up the screen of course and █████ is entirely engaging.
SarahBrown	training	Simba	Brilliant the way Timone and Pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help █████ when he needed them.
SarahBrown	training	Pumbaa	Then he meets ██████ and things do change.
SarahBrown	training	Simba	Then █████ turns up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous 2 films.
SarahBrown	training	James Belushi	If you like █████████████, you will like this film.
SarahBrown	training	James Belushi	I like █████████████, so I liked this film.
SarahBrown	training	Quincy Jones	Music from ████████████ effectively scores it's story.
SarahBrown	training	Santa Anna	██████████ was within his prerogatives to be angry.
SarahBrown	training	Raul Julia	██████████ magnificently carried poor writing through the scene.
SarahBrown	training	Lubitsch	This film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play, without the charm or elegance of Mr. ████████'s own, and definite version.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Morgan	In here, we have the wonderful ████████████, playing the owner of the shop.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	I enjoyed this version much more then the █████████ version I saw last week.
SarahBrown	training	BASEketball	███████████ is awesome!
SarahBrown	training	BASEketball	Trust me on this one...███████████ is a surefire hit and I loved it and will continue to love it.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark's	Thank that to ███████████ extensive use of CGI effects.
SarahBrown	training	Cecilia Cheung	██████████████ is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching.
SarahBrown	training	Countess	In the beginning, I like how she resembles the ████████ (from Zu Warriors) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life.
SarahBrown	training	Cecilia	Oh, by the way, did I mention that ███████'s very appealing to the eye??
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	█████████ takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.
SarahBrown	training	Ken	███, rock n'roll fanatic, marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so that she can stay in the United States when her visa expires.
SarahBrown	training	Ken	But, ███, who seems to be lost in every relationship, takes a liking to Kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out.
SarahBrown	training	Ken	But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese upbringing, and doesn't expect to be married to ███ all that long.
SarahBrown	training	Ken	It's sad in that this is finally someone ███ thinks he can love and be with and all that, except the one time he thinks he's found someone to feel that way about, the girl isn't expecting to stay that long.
SarahBrown	training	Ken	It's not that she doesn't like ███, it's just that she's used to a whole 'nother way of life.
SarahBrown	training	Ken	"She says, ""I can't tell him the way I feel in English, and ███ can't tell me the way he feels in Japanese."""
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ was one of the first movies I ever saw, and to me it is timeless.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ is idealistic and strong, and the mice provided great comic relief.
SarahBrown	training	Lucifer	The stepsisters were also well done, as well as ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Bethany Cox	███████████
SarahBrown	training	Eve Arden	One minor disappointment is █████████ trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything.
SarahBrown	training	Silvers	I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and ███████--a missed opportunity.
SarahBrown	training	Ishai Setton's	██████████████ movie is one of those where you can recognize Life in all its simplicity and beauty.
SarahBrown	training	Don Rickles	It's really interesting to see the mod fashions, the old Vegas, a slim ███████████, chain smoking, and a hip opening song.
SarahBrown	training	Lizzie McGuire'	Too many shows (eg, 'Sister, Sister' and '███████████████) think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard-hitting.
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter	In fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of ███████████ and his character.
SarahBrown	training	David	To know and understand the story of █████ and his journey to become the King of Israel, made this story all the more compelling.
SarahBrown	training	Gregory Peck	You could feel his lust for a beautiful woman, ████████████ showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life.
SarahBrown	training	Susan Hayward's	███████████████ fear, reluctance, but then obedience to his authority as her King was beautifully portrayed by her.
SarahBrown	training	Raymond Massey's	████████████████ powerful and authoritative condemnation of the King made me feel his anger.
SarahBrown	training	Sgt Liceman	"These band of misfit students at Weinberg Military school have been placed in here because, as ███████████ quotes ""because you are outcasts, embarrassments to your families and communities, disgraces."""
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard	███████████████ is not a new-comer yet.
SarahBrown	training	William Blakewell	This all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (█████████████████) penniless.
SarahBrown	training	Bonnie	Not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity, ██████ cozies up to Luva.
SarahBrown	training	Bert	Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, as ████.
SarahBrown	training	Lukas	"█████ had a good career in film (both here and in England - he is the villain in ""The Lady Vanishes""), and this performance was his best one."
SarahBrown	training	Lukas	But █████ was lucky - he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career.
SarahBrown	training	Hellman	"To me the film to look at with ""Watch On The Rhine"" is based on another play/script by ███████, ""The Searching Wind""."
SarahBrown	training	Hellman	███████ could write very well at times.
SarahBrown	training	Nick Mancuso	Yes, this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity errors (like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together), and as much as I love ████████████ he was often a little too good at the burnt-out part, and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles).
SarahBrown	training	Richard Grieco	██████████████ was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip).
SarahBrown	training	Steven Ford	███████████ was very likable.
SarahBrown	training	Grieco	I would have loved to have been on-set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle ██████ would have.
SarahBrown	training	Truman Capote's	"Some have complained not only about the film, but about ███████████████ source ""non-fiction novel"", that the central message is unsubtle."
SarahBrown	training	Scott Wilson	████████████ (still one of the most underrated actors ever) is chilling as the nihilistic leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Blake	████████████ is also chilling as the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience.
SarahBrown	training	Wilson	His character obviously has a voice of reason, but is terrified to go against ██████ (theres a good amount of homoerotic subtext on his character's part).
SarahBrown	training	Quincey Jones	Add another classic score from █████████████, and you have a masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Aatish Kapadia	██████████████ Rating-
SarahBrown	training	Vipul Shah's 'Waqt'	Yes, ladies and gentlemenin ███████████████████, we have probably found this year's first bona fide hit.
SarahBrown	training	Kumar	Ishwar(Amitabh Bachchan), the postman-turned-millionaire(don't ask how!...there's something about selling toys while delivering letters and all thatseriously- who gives a damn!), married to Sumi(Shefali Shah) is a doting father to Aditya(Akshay █████).
SarahBrown	training	Aditya	His love for ██████ though, results in his procrastination of the grave issue.
SarahBrown	training	Aditya	However, when faced with a situation that will test his race against time, Ishwar has no alternative but to throw ██████ out of the house- hoping that the new predicament might make him more conscientious of his own life.
SarahBrown	training	Vhala Fari Malishu'	Writer Aatish Kapadia(he also penned the original Gujarati play 'Aavjo ███████████████████ on which the film is based) does a good job of keeping the narrative fluid.
SarahBrown	training	Vipul	On the directing front, █████ shows that he possesses a natural flair for story-telling.
SarahBrown	training	Amitabh Bachchan	████████████████ is dependable as always.
SarahBrown	training	Shefali	███████ pitches in a finely nuanced performance and matches the superstar at every step.
SarahBrown	training	Akshay	When it all boils down though, 'Waqt' is ██████'s vehicle.
SarahBrown	training	Akki	I have always maintained that ████ is as good as the role suits him.
SarahBrown	training	Mujhse Shaadi Karogi'	Put him in a '█████████████████████ and he's fantastic, but in a 'Bewafaa' he is woefully bad.
SarahBrown	training	Akki	Here, ████ is probably at his best.
SarahBrown	training	- Abhishek Bandekar	███████████████████ Trivia-
SarahBrown	training	Bourne Identity	I watched both ███████████████ and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing this in the theater.
SarahBrown	training	Greengrass	Speaking of frenetic, the trademark ██████████ shaky cam was present and very annoying to me.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	It's enjoyable following leads along with ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	I think they just wanted to give ██████ someone to protect to and confide in.
SarahBrown	training	Clive Owen	██████████ was practically an afterthought.
SarahBrown	training	Scott Glenn's	If they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts, eliminated █████████████ part entirely, zoomed out, and taken the camera away from the seizure victim, it would have been perfect.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	ENDING SPOILER I don't see why they leave ██████ alive at the end.
SarahBrown	training	Nicky	I did like █████ reacting to the news report though.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	"SPOILER SPECIFICS WARNING - QUOTE FROM MOVIE BELOW - ██████'s last line at the end ""Look at this.."
SarahBrown	training	Pamela Landy	If he was angry enough to murder, why not shoot ████████████ after she faxes his top secret file?
SarahBrown	training	Paul Muni	I wanted to see if 1) █████████ could play Chinese and 2)
SarahBrown	training	Keye Luke	█████████, if he'd been given the chance to play a lead role, might have played him in much the same manner.
SarahBrown	training	Baio	████'s skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass, and we are meant to get through them, to better times.
SarahBrown	training	Verhoeven	█████████'s movie was utter and complete garbage.
SarahBrown	training	Heinlein	████████ would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell's	In ██████████████ first big screen lead, he plays a man who has gotten to 40 without managing it.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	At the same time though, he blatantly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member, ████'s friends discover his secret.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	At the age of 40, ████ is still a virgin.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell	"One of the few good things about ""Anchorman"", it was only going to be a matter of time before ████████████ got himself a lead of his own."
SarahBrown	training	Carell	Showing the hopeless, shy virgin to perfection, ██████ is a revelation as he gradually grows increasingly confident as the advice begins to help.
SarahBrown	training	Carell	██████ is not alone however in his performance.
SarahBrown	training	Ranikhet Almora	Thankfully this time all Indian locales like ███████████████ etc have been used, which have been already visited by most of the urbanites, hence adding to the connection with movie.
SarahBrown	training	Bhabhi	I rate the actress playing the role of ██████ in the front league.
SarahBrown	training	Suraj	I want to express on candid thing here that though █████ proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals, his approach is totally individualistic.
SarahBrown	training	Graham Greene	An underrated addition to the █████████████ cinematic canon - its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues.
SarahBrown	training	Shumlin	Director ███████, theatrical director, frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material, and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease.
SarahBrown	training	Marius Goring	This other place, like a heaven, is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world, so they send French Conductor 71 (█████████████) to persuade him to go, but he is obviously in love.
SarahBrown	training	Peter	█████ suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world's court, he is granted this.
SarahBrown	training	David Niven	███████████ was number 36 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, it was number 47 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 46 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and it was number 59 on The 100 Greatest Films.
SarahBrown	training	Paul McCartney	I love ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	████ is still the man and I will enjoy this for years to come.
SarahBrown	training	Jude	I would of like to hear all of Hey ████.
SarahBrown	training	Mel Gibson's	Any one who has seen ████████████ The Passion of the Christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead.
SarahBrown	training	Chris Sarandon	I liked the way that they trained ██████████████ and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew.
SarahBrown	training	Sarandon	Though ████████ didn't have long hair like any other Jesus would in other films, his looks are pretty close to what a Jewish man would appear.
SarahBrown	training	Danielle Steele	My wife says it passes the ███████████████ test.
SarahBrown	training	Garner	██████ did a better job than he usually does.
SarahBrown	training	McCarthy	There was precedent for this approach, for several of the flying saucer films of the 1950s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the ████████ era-
SarahBrown	training	Rod Serling	And the early 1960s saw ███████████ constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show The Twilight Zone.
SarahBrown	training	Carl Theodor Dreyer's	The use of soft, dimly lit visuals, murkily filtered, add a Stygian feel to the New York of the film, almost like a colorized version of █████████████████████ Vampyr.
SarahBrown	training	Hatcher	Yet, one does not know if it is enough, for ███████ has already been co-opted, and has a track record of taking the easy way out.
SarahBrown	training	sci fi	Yet, that fact, and its ambiguity, shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters' dilemmas, and has a depth many later, better made films, ██████ or not, do not have.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	It is also why █████████████ is still a film worth watching.
SarahBrown	training	Bridget Moynahan	I hope they will bring it back ... maybe they are waiting until ████████████████ has her baby?
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	"I just saw ""█████████"" and I have to say that it was the best slasher movie that I've seen in years."
SarahBrown	training	Denise Richards	███████████████ stands out here as a fun character.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Zane	Once again, ██████████ proves he's more than just a Hollywood pretty boy in a silent performance that combines spastic slapstick with understated pathos.
SarahBrown	training	Ed Wood	It has a manic pace and is full of the goofy inventiveness that ███████ is finally beginning to be appreciated for.
SarahBrown	training	Wood	I believe they're all in the movie to show their appreciation of ████, and to do a broad, physical kind of acting not seen much these days.
SarahBrown	training	Wood	It was made mostly out of love for ████'s script.
SarahBrown	training	Donna Summer	"The song ""On the radio"" by ████████████ is lovely."
SarahBrown	training	Kate	The first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than ████ and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring.
SarahBrown	training	Kate	When ████ meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still doesn't become a bad movie.
SarahBrown	training	gore	The second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the ████ effects are well done and the story is quite well developed.
SarahBrown	training	Kate	The bad guy will die and ████ will be the only survivor.
SarahBrown	training	Glen Close	All others in this film were fine, although I wish there had been more of ██████████ and thought the Buddy character was alittle too dramatic.
SarahBrown	training	Jodie Foster's	██████████████ performance is striking, and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies.
SarahBrown	training	Ronald Coleman	The wonderfully urbane ██████████████ is show-cased here as in few other of his films.
SarahBrown	training	Anna Lee	He is handsome, witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering, lovely wife--played perfectly by ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ferdie	Casper and ██████ have some fun together until someone else shows up...
SarahBrown	training	Ferdie	But the cartoon does end on an upbeat note, and I was pleased to see Casper and ██████ happy again.
SarahBrown	training	Harry Potter	It's definitely up there in standards surpassing Bored of the Rings, and on par with movies like ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Sol	"But the great scenes and ideas - like the death of ███, the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with, the ""furniture"" - outweigh the shortcomings of this film."
SarahBrown	training	Eric	You are with your friend ████ throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team(you can pick a team to be on) and you then start your own team!
SarahBrown	training	Tony Hawk's	There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan, and even School II(not part of story mode though) from ███████████ Pro Skater 2.
SarahBrown	training	Pat Barker's	"Adaptation of ████████████ novel ""Union Street"" (a better title!) is so laid-back it verges on bland, and the film's editing is a mess, but it's still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy."
SarahBrown	training	Anna Friel	In short order he falls in love with a local girl (██████████), strikes up a friendship with the Major, and discovers that his long lost grandfather, who fled from France during the revolution, lives just up the road!
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	If only ████████████ were born 10 years later.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	If you can, (or are a big fan) try to download clips from █████'s acts.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy '	"But this is like the ""best of"" ██████████████X-rated' if you will."
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	You will only put down this great ████████████ classic and possibly make someone miss out on it.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	If you wanna know how █████ got Beverly Hills Cop and got famous from it- Delirious is it.
SarahBrown	training	Amanda Bynes	████████████ is such an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show: 'The Amanda Show.'
SarahBrown	training	Vince	I especially loved the show when the character '█████' came along.
SarahBrown	training	Lauren	I especially loved '██████'; she's the best!
SarahBrown	training	Green Eyes	██████████ is a great movie.
SarahBrown	training	Gene	"████ was very proud of this movie, and he deserved the credits he received from writing ""Green Eyes""."
SarahBrown	training	Gene Logans	I was a friend of ███████████ and I was proud to know him.
SarahBrown	training	H. G. Wells'	"The year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of ████████████ great novel, ""War of the Worlds""."
SarahBrown	training	Wells	This film is the only one that follows with some closeness █████' original narrative  as has been noted.
SarahBrown	training	Big Ben	The director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark (███████), but at least doesn't dwell unduly on the devastation of London.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Piana	The Narrator is played by hunky █████████████, in his 2nd film.
SarahBrown	training	John Kaufman	The Curate is ████████████  also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing.
SarahBrown	training	James Lathrop	The Artilleryman, the only other sizable part, is played by █████████████ in his first film.
SarahBrown	training	H. G. Wells' War of	If you want to see ███████████████████ the Worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film!
SarahBrown	training	Bigas Luna's	Probably ████████████ finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Spielberg	And the fact that ████████████████ directed the film did not persuade me one bit.
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	███████████████ gives her best performance ever in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Danny Glover	████████████ should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Steve	Kudos to █████ Carrell(who I had already been a fan of).
SarahBrown	training	Catherine Keener	And ████████████████ is excellent as always.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Boyer	Heart-throb █████████████ was the male star and Domini's object of affection, but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me.
SarahBrown	training	Tilly	The beautiful direction, photography and color, and █████'s dance, are the things I'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not-so-good things all rolled into one.
SarahBrown	training	Rita Hayworth	"""Cover Girl"" is the best musical █████████████ ever made."
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	She does it without the help of her talented dancer/director boyfriend (██████████).
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	Mr. █████ is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers.
SarahBrown	training	Lee Bowman	██████████ is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.
SarahBrown	training	Jean-Jacques'	█████████████ career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil.
SarahBrown	training	Nick Hornby's	"With ""Fever Pitch"" the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes, abandon that tactic when they decided to bring █████████████ film to the screen, something that it would have been hard to do."
SarahBrown	training	Ben Wrightly	"""Fever Pitch"" is a film that presents an obsessive fan, ████████████, whose life revolves into the Red Sox season, and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them."
SarahBrown	training	Barrymore	Ms. █████████ is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Fallon	"████████████, a popular television comedian, turned movie actor, has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in ""Taxi"", in our humble opinion."
SarahBrown	training	Farrelly	The ████████ brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale.
SarahBrown	training	Matt Damon	Having not seen the films before (and not being able to stand ██████████), I was reluctant to go see The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see it for AS Film Studies.
SarahBrown	training	Damon	 However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a film with █████ in it could be enjoyable.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The near-misses between the CIA and ██████ kept you on your toes and throughly entertained.
SarahBrown	training	Damon	Although █████ did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the CIA, I was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of Bourne.
SarahBrown	training	Peck	Ironically ████ being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man.
SarahBrown	training	Neve Campbell	Most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s (except for the shrink's office, which was dated in a different way), and if you leave the █████████████ sequences out, the whole film has a washed- out early 60s ambience.
SarahBrown	training	Tracey Ullman	█████████████ as the neglected wife was quite moving, to me.
SarahBrown	training	Donald Sutherland	Of course, █████████████████ can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Gallo's	The depiction of the parents (Bain/Sutherland) reminded me, in an indirect way, of ███████████████ BUFFALO '66, although toned-down quite a bit!
SarahBrown	training	William Haines	"""Wisecracker,"" the biography of actor ██████████████, offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies."
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	The old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films, but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a Los Angeles museum screening of SHOW PEOPLE, the late silent feature in which he co-starred with █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Haines	Beforehand, ██████ was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter, but he was pleasantly surprised (and no doubt relieved) at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	SHOW PEOPLE also stands as the best surviving work of █████████████, a first-rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes.
SarahBrown	training	Vidor	By the late '20s, for whatever reason, Marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies (including THE RED MILL and THE PATSY), but SHOW PEOPLE, directed by the great King █████, stands as her most enjoyable showcase.
SarahBrown	training	belle Peggy Pepper	Marion plays Southern ██████████████████, an aspiring actress who storms Hollywood accompanied by her father, determined to become a movie star.
SarahBrown	training	Dad	"While ███ helpfully suggests emotions to portray (""Sorrow! ."
SarahBrown	training	Peggy	"Joy!"") and drops a handkerchief across her face, █████ assumes the appropriate expression and posture."
SarahBrown	training	Mack Sennett's	Of course, Comet is intended as a take-off of ██████████████ Keystone, but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds.
SarahBrown	training	Dani	however it is even sweeter watching how much he cares for ████.
SarahBrown	training	Dani	I must admit though i did kind of want him to fall for ████ in the end.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	This is the ultimate one-man show in which ████████████ is at his very best.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	Just forget the Nutty Professor and the Distinguished Gentlemen, this is the real ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Delirious	It's quite good too but doesn't match '█████████'.
SarahBrown	training	Rosemary Forsyth	The extraordinary ████████████████ is the main reason to see this flick.
SarahBrown	training	Jessica Alba	████████████ does such a great job in it.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Weatherly	█████████████████ also does an awesome job, as well as the rest of the cast.
SarahBrown	training	George Reeves	█████████████ was my hero when I was a little kid, and I'm 16 now, it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.
SarahBrown	training	Theodore Sturgeon	And coming from █████████████████, another of the great SF short story writers they used in the first season, one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that Sturgeon turned in.
SarahBrown	training	James Gunn	In 1987, ██████████ established the Theodore Sturgeon Award for best short science fiction story.
SarahBrown	training	James Gunn	However, the script was adapted into a book by Sci-Fi writer ██████████ (Star Trek #80, The Original Series) and published by Pocket Books in 1996.
SarahBrown	training	Wung Lung	she won in 1935 (Pulitzer prize) in literature on her eternal novel (The good earth) which made a brilliant panorama on the life of Chinese peasant (█████████) and his wife (O-Lane) and their efforts to face the hardness of hard positions in their earth to reach for their big fortune by their shoulders.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Muni	█████████ succeeded in this role as Chinese peasant that he prepared himself in this role upon his sittings with Chinese people in San Francisco in their town to be Chinese exactly as a real and true.
SarahBrown	training	Shara Reiner	████████████ succeeded in her role as (O-Lane) by this brilliant evidence that she won An Academy Awarded as a best actress in 1937.
SarahBrown	training	Tarantino	The stories come together very nicely in the end, reminding, perhaps, a bit of the way █████████'s movies are made.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	It also received an █████ for best photography, and deservedly so.
SarahBrown	training	Alice	The supporting cast of workers at the Dead Letter Office are wonderful bit-parts in them selves, as is █████'s long-suffering boyfriend, who I couldn't help but feel slightly sorry for.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	It took a pretty dark story-that of ███████████'s Macbeth- and wrapped it in a quirky, often funny and poignant modern yarn.
SarahBrown	training	Macbeth	Kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern NYC and ███████'s Scotland together under one roof.
SarahBrown	training	Harold Perrineau	The opposing worlds act to really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love ████████████████ as the Chorus, a part which doesn't exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Morgan	 ████████████ also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career.
SarahBrown	training	Hammer	"This occult tenth episode of ██████'s short running TV-series ""Hammer House of Horror"" (1980), ""Guardian of the Abyss"", is indeed a creepy entry to the series."
SarahBrown	training	Hammer	"Overall, ""Guardian of the Abyss"" is another interesting and creepy HHH tale, and my fellow ██████ fans should not miss it."
SarahBrown	training	Carol Kings	I have always preferred this sound track to the first one, although I just totally love ███████████ song in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'.
SarahBrown	training	Randell	Riff ███████ is a wildly, obsessed fan of the rock group; The Ramones and so are most of the students in the school.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	But a new tyrant of a principal, Ms. █████ thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students, especially the music from The Ramones.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	But when Ms. █████ discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets.
SarahBrown	training	Joe Ramone	But Riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer ██████████ and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	Especially in the scenes involving Ms. █████ with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	The enthusiastic acting is pretty campy, but that goes down well with the material and there's a certain likability stemming from these characters, but we totally despise Ms. █████ and her hall monitor goons.
SarahBrown	training	bush	There's no beating around the ████ here when I say 'Rock 'n' Roll High School' is an intoxicating hoot, of a rad time!
SarahBrown	training	YOKAI DAISENSO	██████████████ takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness, diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	The film is evidently bigger budget than anything else █████ has done, with lots of CGI to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures (the YOKAI).
SarahBrown	training	Miike	Regardless, it's a great project for █████ to channel his boundless imagination and invention into.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	Those looking for another violent, perverted gangster film aren't going to find what they're looking for in YOKAI, but if you're a fan of █████ because of his imagination and wit, there's plenty to satisfy here.
SarahBrown	training	Irving Thalberg	What ███████████████ did in making this film today would never be attempted again.
SarahBrown	training	Pearl Buck	Perhaps it's partly because the story was written by a westerner, ██████████ who got a Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932.
SarahBrown	training	Buck	Ms. ████, daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to the consciousness of America than any other person.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Ustinov	In The Sundowners there is a great description of comparing China to Australia by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ustinov	When asked the difference, ███████ said China was very big and very full and Australia was very big and very empty.
SarahBrown	training	Luise Rainer	The woman O-Lan (████████████) bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have, drought, famine, revolution, and a climatic locust plague.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	She may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player █████ performance with the least amount of dialog.
SarahBrown	training	John Mills	I think only ██████████ in Ryan's Daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man.
SarahBrown	training	Rainer	██████ helps in the field, bears and raises the kids, does the housework.
SarahBrown	training	Rainer	Still ██████ stoically bears it all.
SarahBrown	training	Buck	Still Muni is not a bad man and it's a tribute to the film and his acting and ████'s writing that you don't hate him and the culture gap is bridged.
SarahBrown	training	Dave	This is one of those movies - like ████, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that holds a viewer's interest time and again.
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	"My favorite line comes from ███████████████: ""Now why can't I write sh*t like that?"""
SarahBrown	training	Paul F. Ryan	Like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one-man show as ████████████ was both the writer and the director.
SarahBrown	training	Ryan	████ takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance.
SarahBrown	training	Sarah McLaughlin's	"Why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song (██████████████████ ""Sweet Surrender"") he goes out on, and the amazing editing of the final minute."
SarahBrown	training	Christensen	Although Phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and ███████████ her intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before.
SarahBrown	training	Ryan	The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ████.
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	What is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie ██████ to the lone shooter.
SarahBrown	training	Ryan	A story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ████ could have easily steered this film into cliché and predictability.
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	She desperately needs a connection that ██████ just as desperately resists.
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	██████ only makes progress when she retreats.
SarahBrown	training	Robin	"But, in a way, they were acting as their ""Batman and █████"" selves."
SarahBrown	training	George Barris	"The movie starts out with them searching for the ""█████████████"" designed Batmobile, that someone stole before it was to be auctioned off for an orphan's home."
SarahBrown	training	Dooblebop	We don't buy into the merchandise angle and have our son wearing everything █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Dani	Court tries his best to make ████ realize that the difference in their ages would make a love relationship improbable.
SarahBrown	training	Dani	Soon the nubile charm of ████ starts winning over Court's will.
SarahBrown	training	Sanchez	While drinking puke isn't really my thing, as far as a substantial entertainment show goes, Dirty ███████ is way out of Jackass's league.
SarahBrown	training	Yasmine Bleeth	He meets the girl of his dreams ██████████████, and in the end they kiss.
SarahBrown	training	Columbo	I liked it a lot, but then, I like almost any ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent	The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the ███████ company.
SarahBrown	training	Gazzaras	"With various Bogdanoviches and ████████ scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is very much a family affair."
SarahBrown	training	Gazzara	Mr ███████ concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together.
SarahBrown	training	Bogdanovich	"Mr ███████████'s triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from ""Targets"" onwards."
SarahBrown	training	Hepburn	Miss ███████ in particular benefits from this love.
SarahBrown	training	Louis Armstrong's	"The soundtrack to ""They all laughed"" varies from █████████████████ 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays."
SarahBrown	training	Mr B	"████,s ""Golden Boy"" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be restored,and when that day comes ""They all laughed"" will be recognised for the fine work that it is."
SarahBrown	training	Delirious	If you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on DVD, it was probably '█████████' you were looking for.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	I never knew where █████ got a big part of his inspiration.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	That's the huge difference: █████ was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful  and more.
SarahBrown	training	George	It's a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many, memorable set pieces - the shoe shop scene, car showroom scene, ██████'s dance to Genesis's 'Jesus He Knows Me,' the conference scene, the fireworks scene.
SarahBrown	training	Dudley Moore	When you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically under-utilised asset the late ████████████ was.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Cook	But mostly he is remembered for his pairing with ██████████, on television and in one or two indifferent British movies.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	'██████' is the result.
SarahBrown	training	Moore	█████'s clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable.
SarahBrown	training	Tommy Cooper	████████████, an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank.
SarahBrown	training	Moore	It is █████'s almost childish vulnerability that is so endearing.
SarahBrown	training	John Guilgud	████████████ in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and acerbic authority that is a treasure to watch.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	He invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his █████.
SarahBrown	training	Guilgud	███████ only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	It will disappoint if you watch '██████' first.
SarahBrown	training	Dudley	Hollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly ██████ after these two outings.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	But '██████' is a sample of what might have been.
SarahBrown	training	Jason Bourne	He really becomes ████████████ in this installment.
SarahBrown	training	David Strathairn	████████████████ was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	This film stands far above the other two ██████ movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!
SarahBrown	training	Gary	"""Groovin' ████"", the original ""Beaver Kid"", is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby TV station in the hope of getting on film - and he certainly does, though not, perhaps, as he initially expected."
SarahBrown	training	Trent Harris	 Director, ████████████, does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story.
SarahBrown	training	Harris	██████ simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town America, the cult of celebrity, and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry.
SarahBrown	training	Gary	In the end the wide-eyed naivety the original ████ is what moved me - when contrasted against these possible interpretations of his situation.
SarahBrown	training	Kelso	I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and █████.
SarahBrown	training	Leo	███ was also an awesome character while he was there, I really hope he comes back because he's hilarious.
SarahBrown	training	Kelso	"It's classic when Fez goes ""you son of a bitch!"", and when █████ yells ""burn!"
SarahBrown	training	Jackie	██████ being hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started out being really good looking but damn, somewhere around season 5-6 she just got Really hot.
SarahBrown	training	Scott Bakula	"Without that annoying ""PRIME DIRECTIVE"" floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool.. and ████████████ was without a doubt a GREAT CHOICE for Captain, and the Vulcan Babe is hot too, (Check out the decontamination scene)I gave this a FULL 10... it blows away ALL the other series openers.."
SarahBrown	training	Jim Carrey	I'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of ██████████ growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	Thanks █████, god bless.
SarahBrown	training	Jason Bourne	████████████ sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with ██████ as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Pierre Leaud's	Watching ███████████████████ character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends.
SarahBrown	training	Norma	The author of Forbidden Love, █████, was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her name.
SarahBrown	training	Matt Groening	This movie came to me highly recommended by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Futurama	"Well actually I watched both The Simpsons and ████████ and it gets a mention in both so I figured ""what the heck""."
SarahBrown	training	Claudio Carvalho	Previous reviewer ████████████████ gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could.
SarahBrown	training	Burt	Thank You for the reunion Adam and ████.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are ████'s parents.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	Red was in the service, so he really pushes ████ around.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	Even though she drinks heavily, she treats ████ and his friends with a lot of care.
SarahBrown	training	Bob	███ giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show's story.
SarahBrown	training	Bob	███ also annoys Red to his full extent.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	████ wasn't in it, which ruined it.
SarahBrown	training	Kelso	█████ wasn't in it for the most part either, which didn't help.
SarahBrown	training	Lucy	Anyway, what was shown here in ████ was pretty good.
SarahBrown	training	Viv Vance	Two complaints - the actress who played █████████ - not great casting at all.
SarahBrown	training	Lucy	Had there been more time, had the story been more about ████'s entire life, then maybe the kids woulda been there more.
SarahBrown	training	Lucy	Wow, that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in ████'s life.
SarahBrown	training	Walter Matthau	██████████████ can't stop working, the man has never learned to relax, take some time and smell the roses.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Benjamin	He's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent ████████████████ is finding less and less work for him.
SarahBrown	training	George Burns	 What hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner ████████████ decided to retire and spend some time with his family.
SarahBrown	training	Benjamin	████████ hits on a brain storm, reunite the guys and do it on a national television special.
SarahBrown	training	Burns	█████ brought a bit of the personal into this film as well.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	Although ████████ seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it is certainly not.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	 ████████ is more of a fairytale than an adventure film.
SarahBrown	training	Yvaine	We also know that the true love is ██████ and not Victoria , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative.
SarahBrown	training	Claire Danes	 I have to give extra credits to ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Cox	Moreover, she and ███ do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	The rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make ████████ an interesting and ''high classed'' movie Overall , the movie is FANTASTIC, the locations magical and the plot interesting.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	"I know; it is not perfect, but under the title ""The Americanization of Lily"" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special █████ Edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative."
SarahBrown	training	Uncle Kurt	"The logical end of the film comes when after the terrible WWI has ended, as she sings the theme song of the film, ""Wishing"" in a darkened theater, one by one the members of Larrabee's squadron appear, including her lover himself, indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even ██████████ enthusiastically joins in the singing of ""It's a Long To Tipperraree"", to indicate all is well with the world again."
SarahBrown	training	Edwards	It is hard to say enough nice things about the pace, or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by ███████ to leaven the horrors of actual warfare, to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization..
SarahBrown	training	Lili	This comedy also helps prepare the way for ████'s conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	"I consider it to be █████ Edwards'masterpiece of directing; and under the title ""The Americanization of Lili"" I believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard I know."
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	"█████████████ gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the ""Whistling in the Dark"" production number."
SarahBrown	training	Audiard	Garde à Vue is a wordy film, essentially based upon dialogs (written by ███████ by the way)and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Bates	Well, yes, but █████████████ had lived in India as a boy, and spoke Urdu fluently.
SarahBrown	training	Rangi Ram'	The show's detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer '██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Williams	Presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose Sergeant-Major ████████ ( the brilliant Windsor Davies ), who regarded them all as 'poofs'.
SarahBrown	training	Rangi	█████ was like a wise old sage, beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure Hindu proverbs.
SarahBrown	training	Williams	Each edition closed with him warbling 'Land Of Hope & Glory' only to be silenced by a 'Shut Up!' from ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Mum	Though never quite equalling 'Dad's Army' in the public's affections, '███' nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons.
SarahBrown	training	Estelle	In 1975, Davies and ███████ topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut 'Whispering Grass'.
SarahBrown	training	Bates	The show hit crisis point three years later when █████ died of cancer.
SarahBrown	training	Char Wallah	The last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave India by boat for Blighty, the ███████████ watching them go with great sadness ( as did viewers ).
SarahBrown	training	David Lean's	If a white man blacked-up is so wrong, why does ████████████ 1984 film 'A Passage to India' still get shown on television?
SarahBrown	training	Alec Guinness	( it featured █████████████ as an Indian, and won two Oscars! ).
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Perry's	It was derived from █████████████ own experiences.
SarahBrown	training	Mum	███' was both funny and truthful, and viewers saw this.
SarahBrown	training	Williams	"As ████████ would say: ""I'll have no gossiping in this jungle!"""
SarahBrown	training	Tiny Tim	 This movie has the best ████████ by far.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Walters	███████████████ still has all or most of his baby teeth.
SarahBrown	training	Susannah York	█████████████ and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life.
SarahBrown	training	Edward Woodward	███████████████ is the best Ghost of Christmas Present I've ever seen.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	In this he shows anger at Scrooges attitudes and really makes ███████ reconsider.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	 The costumes and the sets really bring the London of ███████ time to life.
SarahBrown	training	Ramallo	When we meet the adult ███████ again, he is on his way to a sanatorium.
SarahBrown	training	Manuel Tur	To his surprise, ██████████, one of his boyhood friends is also being treated, and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care.
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Bergonzino	████████████████ makes an impression as Tur, the vulnerable youth.
SarahBrown	training	Simon Andreu	████████████ is perfect as Alcantara.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Anderson's	███████████████ first successful movie was a violent thriller.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	They are replaced by better, genetically engineered soldiers and ████, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left for dead.
SarahBrown	training	Anderson	Big, violent, loud action ensues and Peoples' script turns into an ████████ action-fest.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival	I just saw this delightful Japanese feature film at the 5th Annual ████████████████████████████████████ in the historic Virginia Theatre in Champaign, Illinois.
SarahBrown	training	Suo Masauki	Writer/director ███████████
SarahBrown	training	Kusakari Tamiyo	 He enlists the aid of his real-life wife, professional ballet dancer ███████████████ in her first and, so far, only motion picture.
SarahBrown	training	Yakusyo Koji	Salaryman ████████████ is the main star of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Tudor Chirila	I love █████████████ and maybe that's why i enjoyed the movie so much.
SarahBrown	training	Biograph	This early ████████ short was so much fun to watch.
SarahBrown	training	Henry	"As the lady passes out from shock and fear, once she realizes she's doomed, █████ picks up his instrument and ""fans"" it over her."
SarahBrown	training	Henry B. Walthall	From that moment I was charmed by █████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Buck	In ████'s story, Wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the land.
SarahBrown	training	Buck	████'s stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world.
SarahBrown	training	Luise Rainer	The German-born ████████████ brings a tentative but determined Peasant Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan.
SarahBrown	training	Wang	Muni likewise captures the naive but honorable ████, eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant.
SarahBrown	training	Anne DeSalvo	I've always knew ████████████ was a great character actor, now I know she is a great writer/director also.
SarahBrown	training	Lee Grant	It's so rare to see █████████ these days in anything.
SarahBrown	training	Cloris Leachman	It's also wonderful to see ███████████████ in something other than a sit-com.
SarahBrown	training	Adrian Paul	I would have selected ███████████ to play the Captain and an older human to be the doctor.
SarahBrown	training	Linda Park	██████████, an outstanding ballroom dancer from Boston College, is sure to develop nicely.
SarahBrown	training	Nick Nolte's	It takes a little while to get used to ████████████ Nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	█████, an American, moves to Germany, marries a famous actress, and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out.
SarahBrown	training	John Goodman	He's visited by a jovial American, ████████████, who persuades him to accept a post as an anti-Semitic radio broadcaster for the Nazis.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	█████ has no politics but thinks it's a challenge to write a role that's almost impossible and then play it himself.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	Another American secret agent will modify █████'s radio scripts -- inserting a cough here, a sneeze there -- that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the Allies.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	█████ plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in Germany.
SarahBrown	training	Sheryl Lee	His adored wife, ██████████, knows nothing of what's going on, nor does she care.
SarahBrown	training	Alan Arkin	By 1960, he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor, the painter ██████████, who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	█████ can talk with, but not see, the occupant of the cell above his in jail.
SarahBrown	training	Adolf Eichmann	It's ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	He advises █████ that it's a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	"█████ laughs out loud and shouts, ""That's how I GOT here."""
SarahBrown	training	Arkin	"At one point in their relaxed conversations, █████ tells him that ""in spite of everything I still think people are good at heart."""
SarahBrown	training	Anne Frank	I don't know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn't, that's the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater-goers who may never have heard of ██████████ let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	"█████ refers to the war-time relationship between him and his wife as ""a nation of two."""
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	What ████████ is describing is far more than depression.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	Adolescents might like to THINK they know what's holding █████ in that one spot, but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Frost's	Remember ██████████████ line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in?
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	Well no place will take █████ in.
SarahBrown	training	Elinore	███████ accepts the position (seven dollars a week!) and moves up to Wyoming with her daughter.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	What is worse, ███████ turns out to be taciturn to the point of being almost silent.
SarahBrown	training	Grandma	"""You'd better learn before winter,"" replies ███████."
SarahBrown	training	Grandma	███████ is their nearest neighbor (and the local midwife) and still she lives ten miles away!
SarahBrown	training	Elinore	███████'s routine (and her employer's) is one of endless, backbreaking labor, where there are no modern conveniences and where everything must be made, fixed or done by hand.
SarahBrown	training	Elinore	But despite the constant toil and fatigue, ███████ is always looking for other opportunities.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	She learns that the tract adjacent to ███████'s is unclaimed.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	Naturally, ███████ learns what she has done.
SarahBrown	training	Elinore	The stunned ███████ realizes that this is the only real alternative, and accepts.
SarahBrown	training	Elinore	███████ has the baby all by herself, with no help whatsoever.
SarahBrown	training	Elinore	He and ███████ must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	██████ can hold its own with the likes of My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	She falls in love but when spring comes along, she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal that ███ has put her on.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	It's a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that ███ has.
SarahBrown	training	Lindsey	He can't part from what he loves the most, that's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to ███████ in real life.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	I couldn't image ██████████████ in a serious role, but his performance truly exemplified his character.
SarahBrown	training	Darling Lili	████████████ is fantastic!
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	As █████████████ is my most favorite actress and singer by far, I was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is.
SarahBrown	training	Blake Edwards	This movie is just...great (I'm running out of adjectives!), it's magnificent, marvellous, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad, and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews!And to her husband, director █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lili	There meeting was planned by the German Government (I'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them, but you get the point), because the warm, happy, singing entertainer ████ is actually a German Spy.
SarahBrown	training	Cooper	Those precious initial few seconds when he's standing alone outside the restaurant, just before he gets the call - speak volumes about ██████'s ability to convey a character by just being there without saying anything.
SarahBrown	training	Yvan Attal	I really need to see more work by ██████████ as I seem to like him a lot!
SarahBrown	training	Tim	 ███ who is said to have a genius IQ doesn't seem to pick up on Gina's attempt to trap him even when he later sees her at a bowling alley with her fellow cops spending a night out.
SarahBrown	training	Tim	Playing some weird cat and mouse game with her ███ at one point get's Gina, at knife point, to admit that she's wired.
SarahBrown	training	Gina	But ████ tells him that she was forced to do it by the police to get a break and an early release from prison.
SarahBrown	training	Gina	That causes ████ to almost blow her cover and that has her later being taken off her assignment.
SarahBrown	training	Capt	 Put back on undercover duty by her boss ████.
SarahBrown	training	Hugo	████ Matuschek, the owner of the shop, is having trouble with his wife, she only a voice at the end of the phone.
SarahBrown	training	Ferencz Vadas	█████████████ has a secret affair.
SarahBrown	training	Ilona Novodny	█████████████ has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments.
SarahBrown	training	Pirovitch	Mr █████████'s life is centred around his wife and children.
SarahBrown	training	Flora Katchuck	You even sense that quiet ██████████████, while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone.
SarahBrown	training	Margaret Sullavan	█████████████████ was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days.
SarahBrown	training	Lubitsch	The director ████████ is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	"Anyways, Disney remains magical in his 1950 animated classic film ""██████████,"" the movie that put fairy tale movies on the map."
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	"We are all familiar with the story of ██████████, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just for saying ""Bippity- boppity-boo!,"" and of course, trying to head home by midnight!"
SarahBrown	training	Cher	████ and Olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay.
SarahBrown	training	Andy Milligan	Say what you want about █████████████ - but if his family was even 10% as deranged as the one in this film, well then I guess he could have turned out worse.
SarahBrown	training	Milligan	It's pretty easy to fast-forward through if you're trying to pay attention to ████████'s original film, which, unfortunately, is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes.
SarahBrown	training	Ingmar Bergman	It just makes me assume that if ██████████████ had made this (the drama would suit him!), the international attention probably would have been immediate.
SarahBrown	training	Powell	The supporting cast is strong in this early talkie, and ██████'s star quality is evident.
SarahBrown	training	Ullman	What an amazing performance from a child...and what an uncanny resemblance he has to ██████, whose son he plays!
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Vonnegut's	"The central question (indeed, a question that has frustrated many critics) of the movie and ███████████████ source novel is, ""is Campbell a hero or a traitor?"""
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	The great █████████████ has done many fantastic Horror films, some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all-time.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	As the lines above may suggest, █████████████ is my favorite actor, and, while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in, none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem.
SarahBrown	training	Don Galico	Price stars as ██████████ (aka.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	Don't we love █████████████ when he's out for revenge?
SarahBrown	training	Brian Froud	Picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the Goblin Mountain where he discovers the Yokai, who are amazing creations that ███████████ would be proud of.
SarahBrown	training	Kato	And the evil ████ and his off sider who definitely needed a hug.
SarahBrown	training	Takashi	███████ a young boy is the one to become their saviour, alongside a red man/dragon a turtle man and a River Princess as well as a cute little creature that, if it had been America they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores.
SarahBrown	training	Henry King	It is actually both  ██████████ illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion, his downward spiral of sin, and his upward climb of healing.. 'David and Bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity...
SarahBrown	training	Henry King	██████████ handles the powerful story, taken from the Old Testament, with skill...
SarahBrown	training	David	One evening, and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood, █████'s eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath...
SarahBrown	training	David	█████ could not take his eyes off her...
SarahBrown	training	David	By this point, it's apparent that █████'s intentions shift from an interest in taking Bathsheba as a wife, to just plain taking Bathsheba...
SarahBrown	training	David	As usual, sin had its consequences, and █████ hadn't planned on that possibility...
SarahBrown	training	David	When a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine, █████ suspects that the Lord is punishing him and his people for his sin...
SarahBrown	training	David	█████ did something that was abominable in God's sight...
SarahBrown	training	David marries	 The soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way, █████████████ his beloved Bathsheba in full regal splendor...
SarahBrown	training	Peck	████ plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity..  Hayward as Bathsheba, is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery...
SarahBrown	training	Hayward	The sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in Biblical film history, is badly mishandled, and the viewers eyes are led briefly to ███████'s face and shoulders...
SarahBrown	training	Albert Finney	Although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (█████████████) that he assists, the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Yates	"The gritty style of ███████████ that worked so well in ""Bullitt"" is again on display, and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence."
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	██████████████ as a young adult in the navy, is troubled.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	Even if I haven't seen all his films yet, I'd have to say that this is █████████ at his peak.
SarahBrown	training	Oscars	The idea that it was nominated for 11 ██████ (even Best Picture of the Year) and didn't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can be sometimes.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	█████████ wasn't even nominated for Best Director!
SarahBrown	training	Oscars	It should have swept the ██████ that year.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Livesey	█████████████ acts like a man possessed to steal the show!!!!
SarahBrown	training	Hank	But in this one, the expression in his eyes throughout, as ████ considered the things that were happening to him, was wonderful and tender.
SarahBrown	training	Valerie Bertinelli	██████████████████ was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	There is a scene in which █████ secretly steals Floriane's garbage bag.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	And █████ proceeds to eat the rest.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	█████ says she cannot do this.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	 But still later █████ says that she is indeed willing to do it.
SarahBrown	training	Baudelaire	" Probably only a female director could have made such a fine psychological show or study of  I would like to quote ██████████, ""Les amours enfantines""."
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy Delirious	██████████████████████ is undoubtedly the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	For those who dont know ████████████ was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a Hollywood superstar.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy Raw	There is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike ████████████████ which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle.
SarahBrown	training	jaco van	too bad ████████ dormael did not make more movies after this one.
SarahBrown	training	jaco von dormael's	"I am really curious about ""██████████████████"" new movie."
SarahBrown	training	COLUMBO	"For an early 1930's film, this step by step ""peeling of the veneer of the mystery"" is similar to the ███████ series, except in this film, you don't have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance."
SarahBrown	training	Simon	"The film's hero (and writer and director) is █████ Geist- a man ""with an agenda."""
SarahBrown	training	Zucovic	With clever dialog, ███████ succeeds in doing this.
SarahBrown	training	Edward Munk's	Any person who can reenact █████████████ 'The Scream' in the reflection of a silver trashbin at a local coffee house should be nominated for some type of award.
SarahBrown	training	Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!	██████████████████████
SarahBrown	training	Peck	"Then come ████'s sonorous voice: ""And my people are going to find that I can't walk on water!"""
SarahBrown	training	Peck	" As ""MacArthur,"" ████ once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry Through him we felt MacArthur's emotions: we knew his anger, his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family"
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike	If you are a die hard █████████████ fan, you may not like this one.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	It proves that █████ is as diverse and talented as I suspected he is.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	He also continues to make his signature █████ films outside of these ones, which is very reassuring.
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike	 Good job █████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Marcello Mastroianni's	I had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of ██████████████████████ passing with numerous unwatched films of his that I own on VHS; however, given my ongoing light-hearted Christmas marathon, I had to make do with just this one!
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	As it happens, it features one of his best performances - and he was justly █████-nominated for it (with the film itself being likewise honored).
SarahBrown	training	Sophia Loren	This was also one of 14 collaborations with that other most widely-recognized star to emerge from Italy, ████████████; both, incidentally, are playing against type here - she as an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual!
SarahBrown	training	Loren	The narrative, of course, depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing, and they both deliver (their on-screen chemistry is quite incomparable); it's interesting, however, that while █████ walked away with the prizes in their home turf, it's Mastroianni's moving yet unsentimental outsider (the film, somewhat dubiously, does seem to equate his sexual deviance with Anti-Fascism!) who generally impressed international audiences!
SarahBrown	training	David	This is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like █████ are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws.
SarahBrown	training	Raymond Massey	██████████████ does a great job as Nathan the prophet.
SarahBrown	training	Massey	As a child when I first saw the film, ██████ seemed like he truly had just conversed with the Lord himself and was an awesome sight.
SarahBrown	training	Alfred Newman	"No doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing █████████████ who also had great successes in other biblical epics like ""The Robe"" and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" along with perhaps 100 other films too!"
SarahBrown	training	Leon Shamroy	The cinema photography by ████████████ is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film.
SarahBrown	training	David	Plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of God, just as █████ himself is struggling with the same.
SarahBrown	training	David	█████ is not satisfied with Nathan's answer, (to paraphrase)that no one can understand the will of God.
SarahBrown	training	David	This is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where █████ is finally confronted with himself.
SarahBrown	training	Gregory Peck	Finally this film belongs to ████████████ who wonderful as King David.
SarahBrown	training	David	His █████ is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	I had seen █████████████ in a couple of movies and really couldn't understand her appeal.
SarahBrown	training	Gloria Swanson	Rather than kidding her own image, as has been suggested here, to me it seems a satire on ██████████████, who did start off in slapstick comedies, went on to highly emotional women's pictures and did end up marrying a Count.
SarahBrown	training	Gloria Swanson	Marion, a top mimic, also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand, that was ██████████████ spot on!!!
SarahBrown	training	Peggy	█████ thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie Chaplin	███████████████ asks for her autograph but she doesn't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	it's █████████████!!!
SarahBrown	training	Billy	"She also seems to have forgotten █████ and her dad - she has developed a ""STAR"" personality!!!"
SarahBrown	training	Patricia	"""████████"" gets a call from the Boss."
SarahBrown	training	Peggy	It seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them - the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old █████ back.
SarahBrown	training	William Haines	██████████████, another actor whose movies I had always wanted to see, was great - especially in the cafeteria scene , he had wonderful comic timing.
SarahBrown	training	Karl Roden	██████████ was finally not the antagonist in a movie, to start with.
SarahBrown	training	Rolls Royce Phantom	███████████████████; Mercedes S500, and BMW 7; if anyone loves expensive limousine - type cars; this is their movie.
SarahBrown	training	Donald Trump	████████████ is perfect as the boss, even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity.
SarahBrown	training	Jen M	█████ was terrible and should never had made it to the final, IMO.
SarahBrown	training	Pamela	Also, this season had the worst firing ever (██████).
SarahBrown	training	Brian	Best moments was the second episode (motel renovation), with PM █████ fired, a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comedy value.
SarahBrown	training	Randall	Sadly, I think we got robbed for the ███████ vs. Alla final.
SarahBrown	training	Trump	I think █████ was afraid that she could have won, and prevented that from happening.
SarahBrown	training	Brent	█████ was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama.
SarahBrown	training	James	█████ deserved it, no doubt.
SarahBrown	training	Omarosa	The biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all, especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for ███████, who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in.
SarahBrown	training	Alan Sugar	For fans of this i highly recommend the UK version starring Sir ██████████ as the boss.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	Hope █████ really shines in this show.
SarahBrown	training	Islam	While I harbor no love for █████, the departure from the West from Christian values holds no cause for celebration.
SarahBrown	training	Aicha	The director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither, emphasizing the development of █████ as an individual who became a champion, not so much in the ring, but to all those around her.
SarahBrown	training	Akshay	i don't know how come the rating of the movie is 7.3 it should be 9.3 but anyways no one else can make this movie and the acting by ██████ is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending which makes the movie perfect.
SarahBrown	training	A R Rahman	the only thing i don't like about this movie is the music well the background music is good but the songs are not good enough i think the music would be better if ██████████ would be the music director but anyways we can't do anything about that
SarahBrown	training	Claire Danes	I am so glad to see ████████████ working again, especially in this role.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	She is so young, and alive, fully living the joys, mistakes and heartbreak of young ████'s first mistake.
SarahBrown	training	Toni Collette	█████████████ continues to prove that you can be a powerful actress without being a super model.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	████ finds a great deal of strength in her mother's mistake.
SarahBrown	training	Collette	████████ delicately avoids creating a cruel character who revels in the mistakes of her mother, instead choosing the wiser path of learning from her mother's mistakes.
SarahBrown	training	Vanessa Redgrave's	██████████████████ performance is very hard for me to describe.
SarahBrown	training	Redgrave	Physically and emotionally speaking, ████████ is acting in a box.
SarahBrown	training	Hugh Dancy	██████████ spirals Buddy out of control without sending his acting down the drain.
SarahBrown	training	Glen Close	██████████ has my favorite scene in the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Natasha Richardson	The one acting disappointment was ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Gyula Pados	Cinematographer ███████████ couldn't make a film richer in color, light so perfectly matched to mood and emotion.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Russell's	Nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci-fi movie that's been vilified at the US box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of ██████████████ career.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	I'm going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I've seen ███████ pull off.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	████ is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense PTSD - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	████ is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	████'s dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence.
SarahBrown	training	Sandra	Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen's ██████ - but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted - Fear and Discipline indeed.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	Any one of them could pound ████ into the ground - but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	An incentivized ████ given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	████████████ peaks during his 80's movies here.
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte Lewis	Couple this with the hypnotic beauty of ███████████████, this makes for a fun rainy day action-comedy flick.
SarahBrown	training	Eila	His next film ████ is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in Joki.
SarahBrown	training	John Adam	Strange things begin to happen in the house, and █████████ begins to turn into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer.
SarahBrown	training	Agatha Christie	I confess I have not read the book, despite being an avid ███████████████ fan.
SarahBrown	training	Hickory Dickory Dock	However, I loved how ████████████████████ was filmed, it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant ABC Murders, and it really set the atmosphere, what with the dark camera work and dark lighting.
SarahBrown	training	Poirot	The darker moments were somewhat creepy, this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a ██████ adaptation, maybe not as disturbing as the one in One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares.
SarahBrown	training	David Suchet	The acting was very good, ████████████ is impeccable(I know I can't use this word forever
SarahBrown	training	Bethany Cox	███████████
SarahBrown	training	Aicha	Neither entirely at home with her moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with her liberal Danish friends, █████'s martial arts experience becomes a fight to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be who she wants to be in spite of both family and friends.
SarahBrown	training	Semra Turan's	In the end, however, it is █████████████ stunning debut performance that gives this movie spirit.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dickens'	This is the best version of ████████████████ classic novel that I have seen so far!
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Stewart	I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other is the one with ███████████████, but this is the better one!
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	But the best part of the movie was ███████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Ebenezer Scrooge	He is the definitive ████████████████, I do not think that they could have found someone better!
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dickens	 This movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by ███████████████, and I really think that you will agree, you will think that this movie is fabulous!
SarahBrown	training	Blair Underwood	A young and seemingly promising college graduate (played by ███████████████) is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and is put on death row.
SarahBrown	training	Sean Connery	"████████████ plays the ""happy go lucky"" attorney whom the young man's grandmother tracks down out of retirement and pleads with to take on the case in the hopes of freeing her grandson."
SarahBrown	training	Tom	███
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	As a massive fan of fantasy in general, and of the works of ███████████ *in particular*, I've been looking forward to this film so avidly, so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can scarcely believe it's finally here.
SarahBrown	training	Andie MacDowell's	█████████████████ facial expressions are great again in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Andie MacDowell	For example, at a scene where the other women's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make ███████████████ dump the young man, would a mature police officer (the other friend of MacDowell) allow her friend to do such a sinister act?
SarahBrown	training	Reese Witherspoon	I really enjoyed seeing █████████████████ at such a young age, and does quite a good job.
SarahBrown	training	Jason London	████████████ does a fine job as well.
SarahBrown	training	Sam Waterston	And the only other person I recognized was █████████████, who did a fantastic job with his role.
SarahBrown	training	Bette Midler	████████████ is again Divine!
SarahBrown	training	Kirk	████ and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation and so on.
SarahBrown	training	Kirk	This doesn't immediately sink in with ████ or anyone else.
SarahBrown	training	McCoy	Nothing is permanent; █████ isn't really dead.
SarahBrown	training	Bill Hicks	Since a remake is apparently in the works, it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar, half-funny dick jokes, as ██████████ used to call them.
SarahBrown	training	Gabba-gabba	███████████ hey!
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	Call me stupid, but I absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie, █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	So, even if you didn't like it the first time, watch █████████ again and give it another chance!
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	Every once in a while, ████████████ will surprise you.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	But █████ really does work; he's smart, he's funny, he's brave, kind, courteous, thrifty, clean and everything else a hero should be.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	When The Empire Srtikes Back ended with encasing of the lovable Rouge Han Solo in Carbonite to be delivered to Jabba the Hut and young ████ reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his Father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	How he missed out on an █████ is a mystery.)
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vadar	desperate to turn Luke to the Dark Side even if it means betraying his apprentice ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	 █████ managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted.
SarahBrown	training	Lando	We cheer on █████ and the other pilots as they take on the mighty Imperial Fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the Deatn Star to destroy it once and for all.
SarahBrown	training	Vadar	And we watch with bated breath as █████ and the Emperor attempt to turn Luke to the Dark Side while he in turn tries to turn his Father back.
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vadar	But for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Vadar	There is more depth and emotion to █████ than I believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that I think is what makes him so accessible.
SarahBrown	training	Vadar	Without ruining the end too much █████'s final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	████████████ is the master of the Saga.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	Return of the Jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending █████ masterpiece deserves.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that █████ can be proud of.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Cunningham	I'm trying to figure out what the cause is, and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Susan Minton's	I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted ██████████████ book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it.
SarahBrown	training	Minton	I feel disloyal to Ms. ██████ for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work.
SarahBrown	training	Minton	Ms. ██████'s novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character, so internally, that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm.
SarahBrown	training	Minton	I think that Ms. ██████'s work is a real work of literature, but cannot make the transition to film, which in no way detracts from its value.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Cunningham	I'm not sure if ██████████████████ has done anything wholly original, but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work.
SarahBrown	training	Minton	But it's too much to say that it would be better if Ms. ██████ had left well enough alone, because Evening, the film, is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.
SarahBrown	training	Xica	████ contains a lot of history of that time period.
SarahBrown	training	Xica	I would highly recommend watching ████ if it is ever shown again on Telemundo.
SarahBrown	training	Xica	The only cautionary statement about ████ is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore I would recommend that children under 14 do not watch Xica.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh	The actors play wonderfully, especially ███████████████ himself.
SarahBrown	training	Robin Williams	It's good that ██████████████ got the comedy role of Osiric, otherwise it could be a bit strange to see him in such a production.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth	It is really great that ███████ decided to use the fullest version of the text, this happens definitely not too often...
SarahBrown	training	Brannagh	I must say that, looking at Hamlet from the perspective of a student, ████████'s version of Hamlet is by far the best.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	I find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier, as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ophelia	Such as how far the relationship between Hamlet and ███████ really went and why Fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	All in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Morrissey	It took forever to get a cast and director, script problems were constant and the cast was not happy (█████████ complained about the movie often).
SarahBrown	training	Stone	In one cute moment █████ picks up an ice pick and looks at it longingly.
SarahBrown	training	Stone	"People just attacked this because █████ is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to ""Basic..."" 14 years after it was made."
SarahBrown	training	Jack	████ moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine, it's a beautiful hotel, absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal.
SarahBrown	training	& Danny	However the Overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide ███████ has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary' people can't.
SarahBrown	training	Stephen King	The script by Kubrick & Diane Johnson, is based on the novel by ████████████ which I have not read so I can't compare them, goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film.
SarahBrown	training	gore	There is very little in the way of violence or ████, a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but The Shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story.
SarahBrown	training	& Nicholson	The acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying ███████████ seems crazy from the very start.
SarahBrown	training	Bernard Rose	The casting is excellent, allowing director ████████████ to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now; they indulge in the craft of acting!
SarahBrown	training	Tobe Hooper	If it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of 'Paper House' is more in the vein of Sophocles than ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ettore Scola's	It is in these dull,empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of ██████████████ two leading characters.
SarahBrown	training	Sophia Loren's	All men would really feel sorry for ██████████████ character.
SarahBrown	training	Marcello Mastroianni's	All women would surely cry their hearts out at ██████████████████████ existential plight.
SarahBrown	training	Ettore Scola	This is a film for which Italian director ████████████ has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction.
SarahBrown	training	Hitler	His idea is to show how the arrival of ██████ changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks.
SarahBrown	training	Marcello Mastroianni	A word about the courageous personnage played magnificently by great ████████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Carpenter	█████████ learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire.
SarahBrown	training	Blade	The female vampire Una certainly is the coolest vampire since █████'s Deacon Frost.
SarahBrown	training	Carpenter	Unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn't █████████ use more of this??)
SarahBrown	training	Carpenter	I'd really like to see a third installment made by █████████
SarahBrown	training	Cybill Shepperd	I've always been a big ███████████████ fan, ever since I saw her series a few years ago!!
SarahBrown	training	James Earl Jones	The basso profundo tones of narrator ████████████████ solidifies its 'God's eye views' and profundity.
SarahBrown	training	Chris Elliot's	Even my favorite films tend to have flaws - Rear Window looks a little stagey at times, ██████████████ character in Groundhog Day doesn't work, the music score in Best Years of Our Lives is too cheesy, the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a little too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish.
SarahBrown	training	Reese Witherspoon	 I am glad that █████████████████ has gone on to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	But █████████████ is in a whole other league.
SarahBrown	training	Tarantino	I bet this is one of █████████'s favourites.
SarahBrown	training	Heston	"██████ casually getting into bed with the ""furniture"" while discussing something else completely unrelated!"
SarahBrown	training	Gespenster	"Yes, the problem of the most German films are in this film ""██████████"" too."
SarahBrown	training	Nina	Thats not clear for the other girl ████ in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	But ████ lost everything.
SarahBrown	training	Herbert Achterbusch	There is no way - but you must take it said ███████████████████ for twenty years.
SarahBrown	training	Toni	In this scene ████ will lying on.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	And then ████ will say the truth.
SarahBrown	training	Toni	In the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on- than ████ goes away...
SarahBrown	training	Smits	This is arguably █████ best performance.
SarahBrown	training	Technicolor	It's shot in gorgeous ███████████ (try to see it on DVD) where every frame is breath-takingly beautiful.
SarahBrown	training	Dietrich	████████ is always dressed to the 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and strikes hysterical poses to show off the clothes and her body.
SarahBrown	training	Boyer	█████ just walks around looking stricken (no shock there).
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Quintessentially British for upholding British heritage (███████████, beer, fair play, good manners), it is also visibly Americanised in its baroque compositions, technical inventiveness and a fine multi-ethnic cast.
SarahBrown	training	Peter	Resigned to dying, █████ nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour, charm and outpouring confessions, and his warm affiliation with June closes with a mutual exchange of 'I love you.'
SarahBrown	training	Peter	 Keeping with the magic of the moment, █████, by oversight of his Conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the 'Other World,' escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach.
SarahBrown	training	Peter	But █████ is adamant to live because of June and the Conductor's mistake, and wilfully guards his corner.
SarahBrown	training	Peter	The unlikely affection shared between █████ and June never turns mushy or verbose; it's treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love, so it can keep them together.
SarahBrown	training	Peter	 The French Conductor, who can freeze time and people's bodies, obtrudes many of their key moments together, lecturing █████ about history and among his mischievous tricks, pinching Peter's 'Top 100 Game Tricks' book and his coffee cup.
SarahBrown	training	Austin Powers	It is very different from Hollywood ones, e.g. █████████████ or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes.
SarahBrown	training	Sugiyama	I was so delighted seeing that ████████ (the main role) has found the meaning of life in dancing.
SarahBrown	training	Aoki	And yes ████ is funny :-D
SarahBrown	training	Altman	"This movie has some ██████-like flavor (he's mentioned in the end credits as a ""thanks"" person) utilizing seemingly independent unrelated plot lines that intertwine as the film draws to its climax."
SarahBrown	training	David Dorfman	The script is uncluttered, the dialog is free from cliché and thoughtful (especially between Macy and █████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Stepford	The Stepford Children is the second best Stepford movie in the ████████ series.
SarahBrown	training	Stepford	I have seen all of the ████████ movies, and I like all of them.
SarahBrown	training	Barbara Eden	████████████ did a bang up job as usual.
SarahBrown	training	Barbara Eden	████████████ is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurturing type of person.
SarahBrown	training	Don Murray	██████████ as the husband and father was just perfect in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Hamlet is probably the most faithful adaptation of ███████████ to a film and yet is a very dynamic film, almost an action thriller.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	I know many true Star Wars fans hated ████████████ for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity.
SarahBrown	training	Carrie Fisher	Oh, and, err -- █████████████ looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit.
SarahBrown	training	Baseketball	Along with all their other debuts, I think ███████████ is the prize winner.
SarahBrown	training	Ozzy Osbourne	It's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people, like █████████████, who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak.
SarahBrown	training	Claude Miller	GARDE A VUE is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station, and mostly to one interrogation room, but director █████████████ (who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS, among others) intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography.
SarahBrown	training	Lino Ventura	████████████ is superb as usual, succeeding to legitimize a character that, on paper, is cliche: the laconic, hard-nosed, world-weary homicide detective.
SarahBrown	training	Michel Serrault	███████████████ is equal to the task as the suspected child-killer who shrewdly spars with the single-minded flic.
SarahBrown	training	Serrault	████████'s character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning, and pitiable; then later....
SarahBrown	training	Michael Pollard	███████████████ looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Walken	██████████████████ is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role.
SarahBrown	training	Supernanny	ABC has stupid shows like ██████████ and whatnot but doesn't give time to good ones like Six Degrees.
SarahBrown	training	JJ Abrams	█████████ delivered, he's awesome, I wish ABC could just trust him enough to complete the story.
SarahBrown	training	David Zucker	████████████ has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Stack	"The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes, sports announcers, and other celebrities, especially a hilarious bit with ████████████ of ""Unsolved Mysteries."""
SarahBrown	training	Zucker	All in all, ██████ has achieved, in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports, a home dunk.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	It's more than obvious that █████ is more than attracted to Floriane.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Bay	This is a quiet little film that takes time to work it's way into your system (███████████ fans,take note:the pacing here is s-l-o-w,so steer
SarahBrown	training	clear),but	██████████ if you have no problem with this, Water Lillies is a charmer.
SarahBrown	training	Tsanders	I always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where Mr. ████████ explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area.
SarahBrown	training	Rachel Griffths	This theme is superbly portrayed in the short film 'Tulip', directed by the award winning Australian actress, ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ruth	Will (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell) greets ████ as she is spooning the milk from the bucket.
SarahBrown	training	Ruth	The tragic passing of ████ affects Will deeply.
SarahBrown	training	Ruth	At Will's moment of despair, Tulip becomes the symbol of ████, the genuine connection Will has with his late wife.
SarahBrown	training	Ruth	It was through Tulip that Will learns to cope with the absence of ████ and overcome the heartrending feelings of loneliness.
SarahBrown	training	Charles 'Bud' Tingwell	██████████████████████ brings the character to life through personal investment.
SarahBrown	training	Audrey Tingwell	The recent loss of his own wife (███████████████) is effectively reflected in his acting.
SarahBrown	training	Ruth	Although ████ does not say a single word throughout the movie, her sweet personality and loving relationship with Will are obvious.
SarahBrown	training	Griffths	An anecdote from ████████' childhood, the story of loss and discovery is remarkably captured in 'Tulip'.
SarahBrown	training	Julie A. Roberts	████████████████, Streamwood, IL
SarahBrown	training	Paul Verhoeven	"Contains spoilers ""Hollow Man"" is probably the weakest movie that ██████████████, director of great movies like ""Total Recall"", ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Robocop"" has ever made."
SarahBrown	training	Verhoeven	For some reason, █████████ got stuck with an utterly mediocre script, and he made the best of it.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Bacon	The ending is especially ridiculous <SPOILER>, as ███████████ keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) have killed him.
SarahBrown	training	Verhoeven	But all in all, █████████ manages to stay well above average with this movie.
SarahBrown	training	McBain	██████ then asks his good ol' Vietnam buddies to help him.
SarahBrown	training	Boccelli	"Now, I haven't seen Glickenhaus' ""Shakedown/Blue Jean Cop"" yet, but I'm almost ready to bet half a hundred-dollar bill that ████████ gets hung up in that movie too!"
SarahBrown	training	Puya	I applaud ████'s entering the movie business.
SarahBrown	training	Meena Mumari's	Maybe it's the absence of superfluous dialogue, or maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just ██████████████ feet, but it's a joy to watch this movie again and again.
SarahBrown	training	Catherine Trammell	It takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional character...that being ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	████████████ is awesome in this role, just like she was in the first one.
SarahBrown	training	Catherine	█████████ is hers and she plays her to perfection.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier	██████████████ creates a noir atmosphere of post-war Germany utterly captivating.
SarahBrown	training	Oprah Winfrey	Not far behind her was █████████████ as Sofia, the fiery woman tamed by fate.
SarahBrown	training	Norman Jewison	██████████████, a fellow Canadian, takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious, as this one is.
SarahBrown	training	Cher	I have often wondered at the paucity of ████'s acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on.
SarahBrown	training	Nicolas Page	████████████ plays the angst ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat.
SarahBrown	training	Lori Swanberg	Sincerely, █████████████ l.swanberg@yahoo.com
SarahBrown	training	Artemisia	When they were in court, he had *not* admitted guilt of rape out of pity for █████████'s torture (unlike what the movie portrays).
SarahBrown	training	Artemisia	In reality, he had tried to portray █████████ as a loose, promiscuous woman with insatiable sexual urges.
SarahBrown	training	Tassi	In the movie, his sister testified in court that Tassi had a wife and had sexual relations with his sister-in-law, and █████'s character was all the while made to appear as if his sister had been slandering him regarding his alleged affair with his sister-in-law (although he admits to having had a wife back in Florence).
SarahBrown	training	Tassi	█████ was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife, whom he had begotten from rape.
SarahBrown	training	Tassi	And to add to that, █████ really had sexual relations with his sister-in-law, impregnating her in the process, but all this wasn't really mutual as well - again, he had raped his sister-in-law before.
SarahBrown	training	Artemisia Gentileschi	One thing remains true and its the fact that █████████████████████ has been credited as the first woman painter in history, and although her mastery of the art rivalled many of her male peers, she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman, in 17th century Italy.
SarahBrown	training	Fred MacMurray/Carole Lombard	The third █████████████████████████████ film is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Quinn	Also █████████████ is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the make for Lombard.
SarahBrown	training	Ray Purbs	Set in London in 1969- █████████, a hippy, is the editor of an anarchist magazine.
SarahBrown	training	Citizen Smith'	This sitcom had a feel of '██████████████ about it.
SarahBrown	training	Ray	As it was on in 1999 and has yet been repeated on terrestrial television- my memories aren't too good of the sitcom, yet I remember two episodes really clearly, the first being the opener 'Protesting Hippies' which I thought was a great start- where ███ goes on a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was 'Hippy Dippy Hippies' which I think was episode 4, again quite a clear memory about the Police.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur Matthews	The BBC commissioned another series, but ███████████████ decided against it because of the negative reaction.
SarahBrown	training	Robert DeNiro	From there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, █████████████ as a gay pirate.
SarahBrown	training	DeNiro	On that note, ██████'s performance is spot-on...
SarahBrown	training	DeNiro	it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching ██████'s own opening up into alternate forms of acting).
SarahBrown	training	DeNiro	██████ hasn't been so unique to his own image since Brazil, and that's saying something.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	████████ is the type of movie, perhaps, that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time.
SarahBrown	training	Xica da Silva	Having grown up in the relative security of his house, the young and beautiful █████████████ finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town, refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter.
SarahBrown	training	Xica	In a desperate bid to save herself, ████ steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king, intending to use them to escape.
SarahBrown	training	Martin	██████, the diamond commender's son, swears vengeance.
SarahBrown	training	Joao Fernandes	To the town of Tijuco, however, comes the new diamond commender, the elegant and ruthless ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Xica da Silva	"""█████████████"" is definitely a must."
SarahBrown	training	Alyssa Milano	It's a wonderful, adventurous storyline, and █████████████ is wonderful at playing the wholesome, confident, no-nonsense Fizzy...a great role-model.
SarahBrown	training	Preston	When 'rogue' brother ███████ arrives, a moral dilemma ensues.
SarahBrown	training	John 'Drew' Barrymore	█████████████████████ steals the show as the younger, impressionable brother-Barrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse.
SarahBrown	training	"Ann Shirley,""Murder"	███████████████████
SarahBrown	training	Loy	Grant is his usual flippant self, while ███ does quite well as merely a wife.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Torrance	█████████████ is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism.
SarahBrown	training	Torrance	But, the manager advised ████████ about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	Even before they got there, his son █████, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasn't good and didn't want to go.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, ████ began acting strange, irritated, and depressed.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	Scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to █████, and someone who attacked him violently.
SarahBrown	training	Grady	"█████ tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are ""intruders"" in the hotel."
SarahBrown	training	Jack	Obeying this order, ████ went for the objective and many of the most scary things I've ever seen happen here.
SarahBrown	training	Leo	The American, named ███, doesn't fully get what he's doing there.
SarahBrown	training	Leo	His uncle, who works on the railroad, gets ███ a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas.
SarahBrown	training	Uncle Kessler	These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's █████████████ postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Constantine	Another guest at the house is █████████████████, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber American intelligence man.
SarahBrown	training	Uncle Kessler	He can confirm that █████████████ was a war criminal, though it is all completely baffling to Leo.
SarahBrown	training	Leo	Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades, but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than ███, who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train.
SarahBrown	training	Lars Von Trier	The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director, ██████████████, whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography.
SarahBrown	training	Max von Sydow's	And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as ███████████████ voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.
SarahBrown	training	Lajos Koltai's	"Halfway through ██████████████ ""Evening,"" a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination: ""Can you tell me where my life went?"""
SarahBrown	training	Vanessa Redgrave	The line could be embarrassingly theatrical, but the woman speaking it is ████████████████, delivering it with utter simplicity, and the question tears your heart out.
SarahBrown	training	Susan Minot's	Time and again, the film based on █████████████ novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness, it holds attention, offers admirable performances, and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have.
SarahBrown	training	Sara Polley's	"With only six months of the year gone, there are now two memorable, meaningful, worthwhile films in theaters, the other, of course, being █████████████ ""Away from Her."""
SarahBrown	training	Koltai	"Instead, ██████ - the brilliant Hungarian cinematographer of ""Mephisto,"" and director of ""Fateless"" - created a subtle ensemble work with a ""Continental feel,"" the story taking place in a high-society Newport environment, in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble."
SarahBrown	training	Koltai	"Missed connections, wrong choices, and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera, but the quality of the writing, ██████'s direction, and selfless acting raise ""Evening"" way above that level, into the the rarified air of English, French (and a few American) family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting."
SarahBrown	training	Wilson	Dancy and ██████ are well worth the price of admission too.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	Karloff and ██████, of course, shine as always, and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography.
SarahBrown	training	Janos Rukh	Karloff plays Dr. ██████████, a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope, and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	It is somewhat odd that Karloff, who was in fact British, plays a Hungarian scientist here while ██████, who was Hungarian, plays a French Scientist, but they are both excellent as usual.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	By the way, this is one of the few films, if not the only one, in which it is obvious that ██████ was actually taller than Karloff.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	Other than the casting of Karloff and ██████, the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography, as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	My main complaint is that I would have wished for more screen time for ██████, and for his role to have a bit more significance.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi/Karloff	"Otherwise, ""The Invisible Ray"" is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic Horror/Sci-Fi cinema, and a must-see for all my fellow ██████████████ fans."
SarahBrown	training	Jamie Hall's	Also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear ████████████ truly great musical score.
SarahBrown	training	John Bennett	The linking story sees ████████████ as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house.
SarahBrown	training	Denholm Elliott	The first story sees ███████████████ as a writer of crime stories.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Duffell	Some excellent direction by █████████████, particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script.
SarahBrown	training	Elliott	███████'s performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Cushing	The second story sees █████████████ move into the house.
SarahBrown	training	Cushing	He is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on ███████'s loneliness.
SarahBrown	training	Cushing	This is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside ███████'s mind.
SarahBrown	training	Cushing	Anyway, ███████ sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Lee - my	The third story and easily the best sees ████████████████████ favourite horror actor of all time - move into the house with his daughter.
SarahBrown	training	Lee	Mr. ███ gives one his perfect ice cold performances here.
SarahBrown	training	Nyree Dawn Porter	The governess, played by █████████████████ in another of her superb performances, tries to find out what is wrong.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Lee's	█████████████████ presence is truly electrifying in every scene he's in.
SarahBrown	training	Chloe Franks	████████████ deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie.
SarahBrown	training	Jon Pertwee	███████████ plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house.
SarahBrown	training	Pertwee	When ███████ puts the cloak on, he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire.
SarahBrown	training	Pertwee	███████'s performance has to be seen to be believed.
SarahBrown	training	Ingrid Pitt	███████████ is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger.
SarahBrown	training	Pertwee	This is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for ███████ and naturally decides to visit the house.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Duffell	I'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn't lie with █████████████, the director, who really does his best with what he's got.
SarahBrown	training	Amicus	Overall, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD, despite its flaws is a must-see for fans of the ██████ anthologies, fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies.
SarahBrown	training	Sally Potter	"But unlike ""Yes"", by ████████████, which I had seen some days before, where after leaving the cinema I felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive, this time quite the opposite thing happened: there was something that dragged me down, and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe."
SarahBrown	training	Nina	████'s life seemed to be dismal and locked, but then, one lovely day, there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams.
SarahBrown	training	Toni	That person was ████, a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots, just like herself.
SarahBrown	training	Françoise	█████████, a French woman, is a victim of such ghosts.
SarahBrown	training	Françoise	Now time has passed, and █████████ is back in Berlin, still looking for the missing child.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	████ could be that child, after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	And ████ adopts that idea, after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion, she also longs for a mother.
SarahBrown	training	Toni	But in the end she is empty-handed, ████ has disappeared with a man, and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	"████ is just a ""niña"", a girl without name, there is no hope for any divine fulfillment."
SarahBrown	training	Marie	There is no █████ in this world to accompany our lonely lives.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	Therefore, in the end, we see ████ all alone, about to walk along the road that has opened up before her, into a future that seems joyless and uncertain.
SarahBrown	training	Jones	Writer/Director █████ wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist.
SarahBrown	training	Jones	"These are only snippets of what's in store when watching ""Cross Eyed"", a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for █████ and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera."
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Costner	And how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an overage, over-the-hill, self-serving █████████████ attempting to make believers out of a critical audience?
SarahBrown	training	Willie Garson	 Also enjoyable was the return of █████████████ to the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Paget Brewster	"Nevertheless, in ""The Big Bad Swim,"" actress ██████████████ is endearing and believable as Amy, the wired-to-breaking point math teacher who not only is being dumped by her husband but also is about to lose her job, and ends up taking a gamble on a new life."
SarahBrown	training	Jordan	██████ is young enough to still live at home with a ubiquitous, video-camera-toting younger brother who spies on her.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	Trouble begins for ██████████ as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town.
SarahBrown	training	Phil Silvers	████████████ plays one of the three friends and does a good job.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	One dance performance by ██████████ stands out.
SarahBrown	training	Tom''	As in ''Peeping █████, the reaction was malicious and unjustified.
SarahBrown	training	Joan	As such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters, including ████ herself.
SarahBrown	training	Jean	As played by ████ Seberg(whose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here), she is presented as an innocent, a figure of purity whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone.
SarahBrown	training	ken	By no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film's first release, it's a performance far beyond the ███ and call of any first-time actress with no prior acting experience.
SarahBrown	training	Niccolo	The superb ensemble cast(all male) portray figures of scheming, Machievellian(although the story precedes ███████) opportunists who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Widmark	███████████████ as the Dauphin is a real revelation.
SarahBrown	training	Jerry Lewis	A comic performance that feels like an imitation of ███████████ far more than an impetuous future ruler of France.
SarahBrown	training	Sascha	Vera leans toward a handsome count but, astonishingly, Natalia is more fascinated by ██████, whom she met on a walk.
SarahBrown	training	Sascha	But, with the concentration that ██████ must give to the chess matches and, with other happenings in his past still causing problems, will he win the heart of Natalia?
SarahBrown	training	Nabokov	This is a lovely film, based on a novel by ███████.
SarahBrown	training	James	█████ gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well.
SarahBrown	training	Irving Pinkus	And I thank all involved, including the creator, █████████████, for having brought it to my family.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Chamberlain	"A corporate lawyer (███████████████████) is dragged into a case involving ""city"" Aborigines, and this is no ordinary case."
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	███████████ is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what's happening, although no matter how many times I've seen this I can't quite grasp the exact connection.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir's	This is a very eerie and creepy film, and is a fine example of ████████████ ability to create tension out of nothing.
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey's	"The dialogue is fast and funny, and ██████████████ costumer deserves - if not an academy award, at least - a stadium ""wave"" of kudos."
SarahBrown	training	Posey	Of course, this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of Miss █████, and she is perfectly cast.
SarahBrown	training	Mary	████ is a superficial party fashionista who isn't above stealing designer clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend.
SarahBrown	training	Aunt	 The script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only performance that disappoints is the ████, in a role that was much too one-dimensional and heavy handed; a more nuanced performance from her, would have deepened the relationship between the two...
SarahBrown	training	Mary	We should all be so lucky... is he the one for ████? or the one that gets away?
SarahBrown	training	Susan	"Like ""Desperately Seeking █████"" it represents something very true about it's time period, but may become irrelevant with time."
SarahBrown	training	Goldie	"This movie features ██████ as pretty as a picture and as dumb ""as a fox"", as they say."
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	This is an excellent movie, with a good plot, fine acting, and for the most part, pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of Martial Art fighting, and ████████████ humor.
SarahBrown	training	Bob Cratchit	Particularly effective is when he confronts ████████████ in his office at the movie's end.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	As █████ stands before a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is his silhouette.
SarahBrown	training	Marlon Brando's	Augmented by Scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing...much like ███████████████ first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	Because █████ displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	"To put it another way, the ""before"" ███████ is almost as charismatic as the ""after,"" even though he really shouldn't be."
SarahBrown	training	Jonathan Harris	"It's what you might call the ""Doctor Smith"" effect, since ███████████████ used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike)."
SarahBrown	training	Scott	Actually, I myself don't consider █████'s glib rage a liability.
SarahBrown	training	Foxx	It will keep you wondering whats going to happen to ████ next.
SarahBrown	training	Kimberly Elise	██████████████ also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen.
SarahBrown	training	Jamie Kennedy	Even █████████████ is in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	a Jamie Foxx	It's definitely worth having if you are ████████████ fan.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Put yourself into █████'s shoes.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	█████ submits requirements that convey her real needs: a 'well-groomed' man.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	His skills as a thief help █████ win a political battle in the office.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	But Paul sees a grander opportunity with █████'s skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	█████ grows more powerful, professionally as well as personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Without Paul, █████ will remain in her role of a doormat.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	 You will hear the world through █████'s ears, from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid, muffled sounds, all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who's talking.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	With one major sense disabled, we see █████'s heightened intuitive power to compensate.
SarahBrown	training	Downey	Also ██████ looks great in his underwear!
SarahBrown	training	Har Dil	After a love triangle story in ███████
SarahBrown	training	Jo Pyaar Karega	███████████████ these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick.
SarahBrown	training	Salman	But of course for ██████'s fan this was something a surprise gift from him.
SarahBrown	training	Preity	After all Madhubala, a prostitute role performed by ██████ is amazing.
SarahBrown	training	Kya Kehna	Her previous role as a pregnant woman in █████████ was not that heart-touching as it is here.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	Then Priya, a very innocent and helpless wife of ███ who only depends on him for a better result.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Smith	Director █████████████████ draws out the drama a far as he plausibly can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked.
SarahBrown	training	Franka	██████ (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good as the terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine.
SarahBrown	training	Terrance Howard	Of course, my favorite actor is ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ebony	█████ magazine did do a nice article on him, giving him some of his due propers.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Cushing	The great █████████████ once again delivers a sublime performance in this, and the rest of the performances are also very good.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Lee	███████████████ is, as always, superb in his role.
SarahBrown	training	Ingrid Pitt	(███████████).
SarahBrown	training	Pearl S. Buck's	This adaptation of ███████████████ film is certainly a classic.
SarahBrown	training	Luise Rainier	█████████████ plays Olan.
SarahBrown	training	Anna May Wong	I think she tried to get the role, but they should have put █████████████ in the role.
SarahBrown	training	Rainier	"I know why they didn't, and Ms. ███████ is very good in the film, but they hardly tried to make her look ""authentic""."
SarahBrown	training	Gigi	First off, I'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the Best Picture Academy Award was '████' in 1958.
SarahBrown	training	Murphy	I don't know how or where ██████ got some of his material but it works.
SarahBrown	training	T	His first time he says the F-word is when he does the skit about Mr. █ being a homosexual.
SarahBrown	training	Gus	And I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes ███.
SarahBrown	training	Gus	Normal kids don't do shit like that ███.
SarahBrown	training	Goonie Goo Goo	Then they looked at each other and said ██████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	 EVIL INCARNATE: ████████████ is a bit long in the tooth, the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding.
SarahBrown	training	YEATS	Rather, she seems to have a slight golden glow (YES, █████).
SarahBrown	training	Catherine	█████████ character is so powerful and menacing that I thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Verhoven	█████████████ pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew.
SarahBrown	training	Sanctimoniously	Example: ███████████████ alleging sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the lead role be switched from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY.
SarahBrown	training	Hackett	"It was, in the words of the reptilian ███████ in NETWORK, ""A BIG- TITTED HIT!"""
SarahBrown	training	Rainer	 Muni plays Wang, a Chinese farmer, who is about to take a wife (██████).
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	All I really have to say is that every ██████ movie gets better and this is no exception.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	So don't go see it in theaters, go experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live, but if not December 11th ██████ comes home to you!
SarahBrown	training	Corbin Bernsen	██████████████ has met four cons over the years, and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small Montana town.
SarahBrown	training	Gwynne	 The first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other, with ██████ and Philips managing to push away their own suspicions to figure out they have to trust each other.
SarahBrown	training	Hoyt Axton	There is also a third, smaller, plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local Sheriff ██████████ against the idiots from New Jersey who keep getting into his hair.
SarahBrown	training	Gwynne	There are moments of misadventures by our four cons, who fortunately put the oldest (██████) into leadership position.
SarahBrown	training	Moon	████ Child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick!
SarahBrown	training	Vampire	It works great as a stand alone ███████ movie.
SarahBrown	training	Andrews	"The opening song by Ms. ███████, ""Whistling Away the Dark,"" will always be in the back roads of my mind."
SarahBrown	training	Abhay	movie starts with █████ and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay	The rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that █████ has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Don't expect █████ quality.
SarahBrown	training	Burt	Adam and ████ rekindle the same on-screen chemistry that never seems to have left!
SarahBrown	training	Bams	The fight scene with the written Boofs and ████ or whatever is fantastic!!
SarahBrown	training	Frank Gorshin	At the end █████████████ makes an appearance.
SarahBrown	training	Burt	He passed away not too long after this DVD was made, I believe, so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to Adam and ████, just as he did to Batman & Robin so many years ago.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Newmar	Thanks to ████████████ to re-living a villain role, also.
SarahBrown	training	Gregory Peck	I've always believed that David and Bathsheba was a film originally intended for Tyrone Power at 20th Century Fox, although ████████████ does give a good account of himself as King David, the monarch with a wandering eye.
SarahBrown	training	Jayne Meadows	King David has many wives, including one really vicious one in █████████████ who was the daughter of Saul, David's predecessor.
SarahBrown	training	David	Turns out she's as unhappily married to Uriah the Hittite as █████ is to quite a few women.
SarahBrown	training	David	█████ sends for Bathsheba and him being the King, she comes a runnin' because she's had her eye on him too.
SarahBrown	training	David	█████ shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him.
SarahBrown	training	David	My interpretation of it is that God admires guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on █████ and forgives them both.
SarahBrown	training	David	Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon and she and █████ are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they're both conquered.
SarahBrown	training	Moore	The only thing that gets █████ aroused is a good battle.
SarahBrown	training	Kieron Moore's	I liked ██████████████ performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear.
SarahBrown	training	Raymond Massey	 No one can lay the law down like ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	David	 So when His own law called for death, why did God spare Bathsheba and keep █████ on the throne.
SarahBrown	training	Porky	I don't consider █████'s to be as funny as Up The Academy, there are some really good laughs throughout the film, and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid.
SarahBrown	training	Cher	When ████'s spineless fiancé asks her to help him make peace with his estranged, moody younger brother, no one could dream the consequences which follow.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy	In real life she greatly admired, and liked █████, and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles, and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set.
SarahBrown	training	Sullivan	I whole heartily give Miss ████████ a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, that has a special appeal for all generations.
SarahBrown	training	John McIntire	This time he's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by █████████████'s larcenous judge of the Roy Bean school of law and order.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	While it's no great surprise which way ███████ turns at the end, he's a surprisingly callous critter along the way, even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it's not his problem.
SarahBrown	training	McIntire	For most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and ████████, something the judge recognises immediately, revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	Interviews done by a young woman named ████. 2.
SarahBrown	training	Vilgot Sjoman	A narrative about a filmmaker, █████████████, making a film...
SarahBrown	training	Salman Khan	███████████ has given is strongest performance ever.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	He tells ███ and Priya that she can no longer have anymore kids.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	███ and Priya decide to go for surrogacy.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	Surrogacy to them is that they will find a girl and ███ and that girl will have a baby together and then hand the baby over to Raj and Priya.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	███ finds a girl.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	███ tells her the situation and bribes her with money and she agrees.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	███ changes Madhubala completley.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	███ tells Priya that he has found a girl.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	███ tells his family that Priya is pregnant.
SarahBrown	training	Raj	Madhubala comes to love ███ and she wants him.
SarahBrown	training	Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai	Other than Mohabbatein and ██████████████████ nothing stood out.
SarahBrown	training	Har Di Jo Pyar Karega	The three main leads confirm, after █████████████████████, they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry(apparently).
SarahBrown	training	Salman Khan	███████████ who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the Mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses.
SarahBrown	training	Rani	████'s Character does not know Preiti is a prostitute until the end...this kept from her and the rest of the family...the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you.
SarahBrown	training	Abbas Mastan	████████████ has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully..I say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer!
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	"""Bend it like ███████"" means making that type of spectacular shot."
SarahBrown	training	Mia Hamm	"The movie is full of little soccer in-jokes, such as the present that one of the characters' parents give her of a jersey with the number 9 on it (property of the great ████████, to those in the know), references to ""Posh 'n' Becks,"" the video homage to the WUSA one of the characters plays for a disbelieving friend (""They *have* that??""), lesbian gags, sports-bra gags, and so on."
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	The story is about a teenage girl in England who idolizes ███████ and wants to be a soccer star.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price's	"Even though it has one of the standard ""Revenge Price Plots,"" this film is my favorite of ███████████████ work."
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to █████ as part of his plan.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	█████ does not accept the negotiation,since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(Han still is frozen in carbonite)
SarahBrown	training	Luke	████ comes as a Jedi knight to rescue his friends.
SarahBrown	training	Yoda	In his last moments, ████ asks to Luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to Luke transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	████ stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	He gives his last advice to ████ saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war.
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	In the '70s, ███████████████ starred in sci-fi flicks of varying quality.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Thorn	He plays ████████████, a detective in 2022 New York.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	In this future, most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Thorn	But when █████ finds out the unsavory truth about this product, he finds himself on the run.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Duvall's	███████████████ performance was excellent and outstanding.
SarahBrown	training	Maggie	Big brawl and ██████ ends up stuck in Panama.
SarahBrown	training	Maggie	██████ is always there for him whenever he needs her.
SarahBrown	training	Clutter	On November 15, 1959 at two a.m. they end up murdering Mr. and Mrs. ███████ and their teenage son and daughter.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Brooks	In Cold Blood (1967) is directed by ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	Of course, █████ had the murder case of his own a few years back, being accused of murdering his wife.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	And █████ himself was in that movie as a boy!
SarahBrown	training	Perry	"When █████ goes to kill the girl, Nancy last, and she says ""Oh, please, don't""..."
SarahBrown	training	Perry	In the last image of the movie we see █████ hitting the end of the rope.
SarahBrown	training	Perry	Especially █████'s character is someone you could feel sorry for.
SarahBrown	training	Doolittle	This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasn't even nominated for Best Picture while Dr. █████████ was.
SarahBrown	training	Cusack	A great vehicle for ██████ and a sure bet nominee to become a classic.
SarahBrown	training	Mussolini	She is a member of █████████'s party, pretty fanatic in her thoughts, and he is a member no more.
SarahBrown	training	Hitler	On the day every person from their building, including her husband and children, is out to see ██████, they are still in the building.
SarahBrown	training	Gabriele	Antonietta's bird escapes and flies to ████████'s apartment, and this is how the two meet.
SarahBrown	training	Gabriele	Right before Antonietta went to ████████ he thought of killing himself, again for reasons I will not reveal.
SarahBrown	training	Hitler	How the story develops from here I will not reveal, but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day, not the fact that ██████ is in Rome.
SarahBrown	training	Loren	█████ plays the scenes very good as well.
SarahBrown	training	Lonely Guy	"In the previews, ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish ██████████ who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't."
SarahBrown	training	Andy Stitzer	I was able to relate to the character of ████████████ more than anyone in the theater because I was the only teenager present at this showing; everyone else looked like they were all past 40.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	"Of course ████ has never had sex and wakes up everyday with ""morning rise"" (don't ask), and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex."
SarahBrown	training	Andy	The truth is, ████ loves women, but past traumatic experiences (revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence) have put him on the sidelines for good.
SarahBrown	training	Carell	██████ is sweet and human, as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut.
SarahBrown	training	Carell	Even ██████'s buddies, who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities, can be related to on a fundamental level.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone fisher	I was adopted at birth and certainly did NOT have the problems ██████████████ had in the movie, but I still share some of the emotions and this movie really helped to bring them out and force me to deal with them.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	"There are just so many issues that are brought out in this movie - and they are dealt with so well by the script and by the acting that ██████████████ should be a ""Best Picture"" nominee for sure."
SarahBrown	training	Sally Field	███████████ is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good, if not perfect, job with her daytime tv-diva.
SarahBrown	training	Downey jr	█████████ may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time, but he struggles with his part which is, to be honest, the most ungrateful one.
SarahBrown	training	Elisabeth Shue	Sadly ██████████████ never seems to be quite comfortable in her part.
SarahBrown	training	Ms Shue	I normally like ███████, but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie.
SarahBrown	training	Mona	████'s disappearance?
SarahBrown	training	Helmer	██████'s comeuppance?
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier's	Then I read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and I have to say, I know it probably wouldn't be true to ████████████████ vision, but I would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned!
SarahBrown	training	Helmer	Granted, it would be hard to find someone to play ██████ as the character deserves.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Altman's	"The Finnish version of ███████████████ ""Short Cuts"", set in the small rural town of Äänekoski."
SarahBrown	training	Altman	Compared with ██████'s classic, this movie is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great piece of art.
SarahBrown	training	H.G. Wells	Frustrated and drunk with power, he turns psychotic in the classic ██████████ tradition.
SarahBrown	training	Verhoeven	This is a gleefully horrible Invisible Man story, delivered with relish by the ever-tasteful █████████ and Bacon as the genius-turned-loonytoon-maniac.
SarahBrown	training	Verhoeven	As with much of █████████'s work it has a terrific unrestrained sense of Boy's-Own comic-book adventure (the secret underground lab where the scientists work is just wonderful) combined with the most horrific and depraved visuals (women in their underwear being groped and attacked by an invisible fiend, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two reels).
SarahBrown	training	Scott E. Anderson	Whilst the story doesn't ring any new twists on an old idea, the CG special effects by █████████████████ are eye-poppingly brilliant as we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissue, bones and flesh all literally appear out of nowhere.
SarahBrown	training	Devane	In particular, a sequence where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where Bacon drowns ██████ in a swimming pool, are absolutely breathtaking in the detail and artistic invention of the effects.
SarahBrown	training	Kristin Chenoweth	 I came for █████████████████ and I stayed because I fell in love with the entire show.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ takes me back, when I was a little girl I loved the princesses of Disney.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ was one of my favorites because I always was so enchanted by the story.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	We have ██████████ who is a beautiful girl enslaved by her wicked step mother and ugly step sisters.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	When the prince sees ██████████ at the ball, he has fallen hard for her.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	But ██████████ must return home at midnight when the spell is broken, all she leaves behind is her glass slipper.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	The next day the prince is on a hunt to find this girl who fits the slipper and is making a stop at ██████████'s house where her step mother has found out about her night and locks her in her room.
SarahBrown	training	Werner Herzog	It is one of my all-time favorites - but be warned, it is weird, like █████████████ weird - its weirdness stems from its super-realism.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	"""Panic"" is the story of a hit man, ████ (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland)."
SarahBrown	training	Alex	When ████ receives his next assignment, he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	But it moves slowly not because it's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate, mirroring ████'s own psyche slowly coming out of the fog.
SarahBrown	training	Sammy	And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche, █████'s.
SarahBrown	training	William Macy	████████████ gives another brilliant performance, as a loving father, a distant husband, and a cold killer, the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires, a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated.
SarahBrown	training	Erik Weihenmayer	As part of their education, Tenberken shares with them the story of American ████████████████, the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest.
SarahBrown	training	Lhakpa Ri	He'll arrange an expedition for them to climb 23,000 foot █████████ and provide all the guides and equipment.
SarahBrown	training	Erik	████'s team are mostly American, mostly male, and mostly sighted.
SarahBrown	training	Erik	When it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience, and that some are much more coordinated than others, it begins to unravel ████'s original plan for them all to reach the summit together.
SarahBrown	training	Walker	In addition to all the human drama to cover, director ██████ and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygen-deprived conditions herself, lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldn't break down.
SarahBrown	training	Gialli	With ██████ and Gothic Tales being my two favorite sub-genres in Horror, I was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while, and even though my expectations were high, this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes.
SarahBrown	training	Barbara Bouchet	"An incredibly mesmerizing Giallo with strong Gothic elements, ""The Red Queen"" delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre: An inventive and incredibly compelling plot, spine-chilling suspense, a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere, eerily lush colors, stylish murders, a brilliant score, and, not least, a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful ███████████████ - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror."
SarahBrown	training	Barbara Bouchet	Fourteen years later, Kitty (███████████████) has become a successful fashion photographer.
SarahBrown	training	Miraglia	"Director ████████ had already proved his incredible talent for style, atmosphere and colorful creepiness with ""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"" and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem."
SarahBrown	training	Grandfather	The haunting painting in the ███████████'s castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps.
SarahBrown	training	Barbara Bouchet	The ravishing ███████████████ (one of my favorite actresses) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen, and she is a great actress too.
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Nicolai's	███████████████ mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets, and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting.
SarahBrown	training	Gialli	"""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest ██████ ever made, and a top-priority for every fan of Horror and/or Italian cinema to see."
SarahBrown	training	Stros	I would try at every way available to see every '█████ game; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet.
SarahBrown	training	Chronicle	I read the █████████'s sports section every day.
SarahBrown	training	Astros	And yes, my room looks like The Shed, Minute Maid Park's gift shop; with a closet full of ██████ gear, including 5 jerseys, 20 t-shirts and you know the rest.
SarahBrown	training	Sergio Leon	This is a true film and while its great in its entirety, the ending is a brilliant, if not unblatant rip-off of certain ███████████ pictures, involving cannons where legs should be, and certainly is appropriate!
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Don't miss this movie, which should have won the █████.
SarahBrown	training	Clancy Brown	"Co-star ████████████ (HBO's ""Carnivale"" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins."
SarahBrown	training	Fritz Feld	Even the smallest roles were played to perfection, like ██████████ auditioning for the potato chips commercial.
SarahBrown	training	Herbert Ross	 Which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film, the direction of the greatly underrated ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ross	"████ who previously brought a two person play, ""The Owl And The Pussycat"" to the screen and made a full movie out of it, does it again."
SarahBrown	training	Ben Clark	Here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play, where █████████ comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special.
SarahBrown	training	Lion King	Being a fan of the first █████████, I was definitely looking forward to this movie, but I knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original.
SarahBrown	training	Pumbaa	Timon and ██████ stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them.
SarahBrown	training	Simba	My favorite parts of the movie include the montage of Timon & Pumbaa taking care of young █████ and the surprise ending featuring some great cameos.
SarahBrown	training	Simba	I could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though, like the real reason everyone bowed to baby █████ at the beginning of Lion King 1.
SarahBrown	training	LK2	"At least ███ had the nice ballad, ""Love Will Find a Way."""
SarahBrown	training	Letyat Zhuravli	"In ""███████████████"", she is unforgettable."
SarahBrown	training	Boris	Just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy German bombardment, or the death of █████ with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies.
SarahBrown	training	Oldboy	This one does, it is nothing like ██████ in plot or style but the same level of quality is there.
SarahBrown	training	Kim	███ in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Sinatra's	"OK, so ███████████████ ""acting"" leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film."
SarahBrown	training	Sinatra	███████ went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this, his first venture into Hollywood, his voice, not his acting, is his main contribution to this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Adam Sandler	We all know that ████████████ wasn't the best at first either.
SarahBrown	training	Blik	Mr. ████ is, i think,the funniest of all like
SarahBrown	training	Nick	I know ████ is meant for kids, but every once in a while a brilliant show appears that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults.
SarahBrown	training	Nick	All of these must have been considered too good, with the exception of CatDog, 'cause ████ felt the need to cancel them.
SarahBrown	training	Gordon	What I like the famous final episode, where ██████ fight a duck.
SarahBrown	training	Mary Ellen	Well anyway you have ██████████ Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance.
SarahBrown	training	E.C.	As from the old ████ comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for!
SarahBrown	training	Joan Collins	Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured ████████████, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!
SarahBrown	training	Harris	Her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and ██████ killed Buddy soon plays out.
SarahBrown	training	Ann	It's not as though ███'s life now is uninteresting, it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned.
SarahBrown	training	Ann	While I grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for ███'s children currently, I was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as I maybe should have.
SarahBrown	training	Claire Danes'	No matter how annoying I find █████████████ angry/sad/crying face that exists in every role she plays, the girl is good at what she does.
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Wilson	██████████████ is always great in whatever I've seen him in.
SarahBrown	training	Hugh Dancy	The real revelation, though, is ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Weber	█████ was especially good, turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester/killer.
SarahBrown	training	Alissia	And I never in a million years would have guessed the reason why ███████ had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti-social goth.
SarahBrown	training	Alissia	This was probably WHY my shirt was soaked because I've experienced that same pain that ███████ was feeling.
SarahBrown	training	James Orwell	Had ████████████ known the Internet becoming reality not long after 1984; In fact it was in 1994; he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did.
SarahBrown	training	Woodchuck	No, this isn't a sequel to the fabulous OVA series, but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of Ghim (and the disappearance of █████████).
SarahBrown	training	Orson	It is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series, which is why characters (namely █████ and Shiris) are reintroduced, and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the OVA.
SarahBrown	training	Parn	The remaining 19 episodes introduce us to Spark, a blue-haired knight wannabe who identifies with ████, and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the Dark Wizard Wagnard from resurrecting Kardis the Destroyer.
SarahBrown	training	Parn	While it isn't quite the equivalent of the original LODOSS WAR (we all love the finale where ████ saves Deedlit from Wagnard, don't we?), this TV follow-up is still great fun for fantasy fans.
SarahBrown	training	Kaoru Wada	The fully-realized characters, engaging storyline, magic, romance, and a superb soundtrack scored by ██████████ of NINJA SCROLL, all give this uneven spin-off some punch.
SarahBrown	training	Lisa Ortiz	Much of the original cast who lent their English voices to the characters of LODOSS return (including ██████████ as Deedlit!), which is a nice bonus.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Cruise's	████████████████ Kashue, on the other hand, is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride.
SarahBrown	training	King Kashue	"(Besides, there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as ""I'm ███████████, and this is my CASHEW!"
SarahBrown	training	Sho Hayami	Because the series was made seven years after the original, all but one (██████████) of the cast members are replaced by new ones.
SarahBrown	training	James Franco	One brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by ████████████ is your typical sensitive but intelligent man-child.
SarahBrown	training	James Franco	I'd recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend ████████████ for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	I just recently watched this 1954 movie starring █████████████ for the first time on Turner Classic Movies.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	 This is a must for █████████████ fans.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Vonnegut	"Now for all the talk of █████████████ being ""unfilmable"" it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments (the other being ""Slaughter-house Five"")."
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	It stays almost entirely faithful to ████████'s book (without being stilted or overly literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	████████ himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that?
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	"I would sincerely encourage anyone to see ""Mother Night"" - it doesn't even take a familiarity with ████████'s work to fully appreciate it (as ""Slaughter-house Five"" sometimes does)."
SarahBrown	training	Walt Disney	Legendary movie producer ███████████ brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	When Disney heard them, he knew he had found his ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Sweet Nightingale	"Woods heartfelt renditions of ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"", ""So This Is Love"" and ""Oh Sing █████████████████"" are perfect."
SarahBrown	training	Mary Blair	" Among the artists responsible for the ""look"" of the film, was ██████████, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by Disney."
SarahBrown	training	Danny	"The turning point in ""The Matador"" comes about half through the movie when █████, an unsophisticated man from Denver, is sitting in the balcony of his Mexico City hotel, enjoying a quiet moment."
SarahBrown	training	Julian	Someone knocks on his door, and knowing it's ██████, the paid assassin, he refuses to answer.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	█████, who has come to sell his program to a Mexican company, but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	It's not until some time later, on a cold winter night that the killer appears at █████'s door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson.
SarahBrown	training	Greg Kinnear	████████████, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this odd couple.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	Hope █████ appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn't she stay longer.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Shephard	████████████████ directs with style working with his own material.
SarahBrown	training	Melvin Douglas	██████████████ is especially brilliant.
SarahBrown	training	the Muppet Show	It has been noted elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances on ███████████████, and they did more than one special together.
SarahBrown	training	Lorna Green(Janine Reynaud)is	█████████████████████████████ a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club.
SarahBrown	training	Lorna	It's quite possible that, through a form of hypnotic suggestion, someone(..a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet)is guiding █████ into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin.
SarahBrown	training	Lorna	After the murders within her fantasies are committed, █████ awakens bewildered, often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality.
SarahBrown	training	Franco	If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from ██████, I'd say it's elegant & difficult.
SarahBrown	training	Franco	"I'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even ██████ himself, when quizzed by critics who watched ""Succubus"", admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it!"
SarahBrown	training	Franco	"Some might say that ""Succubus"" was merely a precursor to his more admired work, ""Venus in Furs"", considered his masterwork by ██████-faithful, because it also adopts the surreal, dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined."
SarahBrown	training	Corman	"""Succubus"" is also populated by beatnik types and ""poet-speak"", ██████'s film, ""A Bucket of Blood"" poked fun at."
SarahBrown	training	Lorna	My personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between █████ and a woman she meets at a posh party..quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually.
SarahBrown	training	Lorna	Loved that one scene at the posh party with █████, a wee bit drunk, writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig(..equally wasted)rush her in an embrace of kisses.
SarahBrown	training	Anakin Skywalker	It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, ████████████████, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).
SarahBrown	training	Han Solo	In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always ████████).
SarahBrown	training	Yoda	They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in ████'s home.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas's	"I don't get the appeal of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Trek"" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of ██████████████ films."
SarahBrown	training	Anakin Skywalker	Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Gorris	Maybe this is because ██████' takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation.
SarahBrown	training	Nabokov	The final consequence is a point of view over Luzhin which dignifies him more than the ███████'s one.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The ██████ Ultimatum (2007) Review: After a thrilling set of two, we get the final installment.
SarahBrown	training	Jason Bourne(Matt Damon	We have ███████████████████████) on the coattails of the ones who know everything.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The ██████ Ultimatum has a great plot, awesome writing, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best action of the summer.
SarahBrown	training	Matt Damon	██████████ delivers possibly his best performance to date.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The ██████ Ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	I love the ██████ trilogy.
SarahBrown	training	Joan Crawford	"█████████████ had just begun her ""working girl makes good"" phase with the dynamic ""Paid"" (1930)."
SarahBrown	training	Joan	████ was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress.
SarahBrown	training	Bert Scranton	Her working buddy is █████████████ (Cliff Edwards) and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob.
SarahBrown	training	Rodney	██████ also surprises her with the news that he also has a job.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	I have seen the trailer for this movie several times over, and I have to say that █████████ looks like it is going to be a wonderful film.
SarahBrown	training	Heath Ledger	████████████ sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces.
SarahBrown	training	Orlando Bloom	Not to mention █████████████ ,who is seen for a split second looks fantastic.
SarahBrown	training	Jess Franco	As you probably already know, ███████████ is one prolific guy.
SarahBrown	training	Franco	Despite coming off as being incredibly pretentious, its amusing to hear all of ██████'s influences.
SarahBrown	training	Cross Eyed	██████████ is a very funny movie with a ton of heart; it's a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout.
SarahBrown	training	Riff Randell	"""Hi everybody, I'm ████████████, and this is Rock & Roll High School!"""
SarahBrown	training	Pacino	██████ was great; he should have been nominated for something.
SarahBrown	training	John Cusack	███████████ was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't mind his Louuu-siana accent.
SarahBrown	training	Danny Aiello	████████████ was superb as always.
SarahBrown	training	David Paymer	████████████ was great in a supporting role.
SarahBrown	training	Bridget Fonda	█████████████ was good but not memorable.
SarahBrown	training	Kay Francis	Soap Opera about a small town married woman (███████████) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway.
SarahBrown	training	Kay Francis	This film has a pretty interesting plot, well, a bit far-fetched perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all *greatly* enhanced by the strong, emotional performance given by ███████████ - she just makes this film.
SarahBrown	training	Kay Francis	Worth seeing, especially for ███████████ fans.
SarahBrown	training	Dave Morse	I was impressed with the supporting actors and of course ██████████ always puts in a terrific acting job.
SarahBrown	training	Omar	And above all, the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age; still, there is some movement in the characters to: Closely watch the villain ████, whose part and acting i liked very much.
SarahBrown	training	Daniel Auteuil	I still think ██████████████ is one of the sexiest actors around.
SarahBrown	training	Down Syndrome	In this French film, he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a Down Syndrome man who lives in an institution with other █████████████ patients.
SarahBrown	training	Down Syndrome	The actors including the actor who actually has █████████████ create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men.
SarahBrown	training	Harold Becker	Director █████████████ is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done Mercury Rising, Malice, and Domestic Disturbance and I think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault.
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino	I mean City Hall is meant to be a political drama, not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out...what else...or rather who else...█████████.
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino	I absolutely hate talking about █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Hall Pacino	In City ███████████ plays the New York City mayor.
SarahBrown	training	James Bone' Funeral	He also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches I've ever seen at the '███████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Pacino	I re-watched that speech four times and the first time I watched ██████ give it, my mouth gaped open and I almost wanted to stand up and applaud.
SarahBrown	training	Pacino	Its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Pacino	He is kind of the focus of the film and him and ██████ have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance...he seems like he's trying too hard.
SarahBrown	training	Cusack	Her performance is very similar to ██████'s in that she just doesn't seem to find her groove with this character.
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino	And of course you have █████████ in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film.
SarahBrown	training	Pacino	BUT it still has to be seen for ██████ and a different spin on the inner working of politics.
SarahBrown	training	John Cusack	If you're a ███████████ fan which I am...
SarahBrown	training	Kei	Unlike most vampire characters, ███ portrayed a vampire that loathed the idea of having to kill in order to live.
SarahBrown	training	Sho	On the other hand, ███ who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man, he grew up to be a man who realised that life isn't all about fun and games, that death exists and able to take away his loved ones.
SarahBrown	training	Lee Hom	I love the part where ███████, the actor who played Son, first appeared on the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Moon	████ Child really made an impact for me, it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration, that we have to appreciate every friendship in our lifetimes.
SarahBrown	training	Sho	"It also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other, even when Son became the enemy, ███ did have some sort of ""fun"" at their last battle."
SarahBrown	training	Miranda	███████ has gone on to do bigger movies, but I hope she always keeps a thought inside for this one?.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Sellers	As you probably know, █████████████, for example, was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters, so that nobody really knew the real person.
SarahBrown	training	a Robert Altman	of course  but not like ███████████████ film, okay!), and not all of them are resolved finally.
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	The rest of the cast all perform well, although I've never taken much to ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Rainer	Having very little dialogue throughout the entire film (and it is a long one), ██████ relies instead on facial and body language.
SarahBrown	training	Lung	When ████ and wife O-Lan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning.
SarahBrown	training	Gackt Camui	Yes, Moon Child has its moments of cheese, camp, and general dorkiness -- I think that's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves ███████████, a man not known for his sanity -- but all in all, it was wholly enjoyable.
SarahBrown	training	Don Sharp	The tenth episode in the House of Horror series is another one I've been looking forward to seeing, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was █████████; one of Britain's finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated.
SarahBrown	training	Rasputin	"Sharp was responsible for some very cool Hammer films, like ""Kiss of the Vampire"" and ""████████:"
SarahBrown	training	Choronzhon	The plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror, but it's actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon ██████████; the demonic guardian of the abyss.
SarahBrown	training	Michael	The mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies, but ███████ is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device.
SarahBrown	training	Michael	When he picks up a clearly petrified girl who's running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed, ███████ is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy.
SarahBrown	training	David Fischer's	Satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical British horror topics, but ███████████████ screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits, among which a highly inventive climax.
SarahBrown	training	John Carson	There's also plenty of tension to admire, the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid (especially ███████████ as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie).
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	██████ has always been a personal film for me for two reasons.
SarahBrown	training	Frank	█████ was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur Bach	Secondly though, I actually knew a real life ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	He was not quite as wealthy as ██████, but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid.
SarahBrown	training	Dudley Moore	He spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just like ████████████ does.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	 The wonder with ██████ is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not.
SarahBrown	training	Dudley Moore	And that's what ████████████ is, a wastrel.
SarahBrown	training	Jill Eikenberry	Arthur, 20th century wastrel, is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at █████ time.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Bogdanovich	'They All Laughed' is a superb █████████████████ that is finally getting the recognition it deserves, and why?
SarahBrown	training	Audrey Hepburn	and of course no classic is complete without ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Martin Scorcese	When the British Film Institute asked ███████████████ to create the American part of its Century of the Cinema series, he grabbed the opportunity with both hands.
SarahBrown	training	Scorcese	████████'s story is primarily about Hollywood's directors  actors, producers, screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention.
SarahBrown	training	Vincente Minnelli's	He even opens with a clip from ███████████████████ The Bad and the Beautiful, one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction.
SarahBrown	training	Scorcese	████████ looks at how genres have darkened and clichés have become challenged, how mavericks have challenged the production code, and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different.
SarahBrown	training	John Ford	For example, he shows us a succession of █████████ films to show how the western evolved.
SarahBrown	training	Vincente Minnelli	He looks at the work of █████████████████ (probably the most often referenced director of the documentary) to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents.
SarahBrown	training	Scorcese	Rather than simply tell the story of Hollywood chronologically, ████████ compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects.
SarahBrown	training	Scorcese	████████ has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures.
SarahBrown	training	Scorcese	████████'s respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully, rather than just giving us tiny bits, and he interrupts them with talking heads (a combination of archive and new interviews) only when necessary.
SarahBrown	training	Farrel	It was done when Ms. ██████ was very young.
SarahBrown	training	Torn	Mr. ████ as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling.
SarahBrown	training	Deighton	An excellent series, masterfully acted and directed, but unloved (I am told) by Mr ████████ and withdrawn by him after a single presentation.
SarahBrown	training	Mukhsin	███████ is a beautiful movie about a first love story.
SarahBrown	training	Yasmin Ahmad's	Everyone probably has one, and this is writer-director ██████████████ story of hers, with a boy called Mukhsin.
SarahBrown	training	Mukhsin	███████ is no different, and probably the most polished ad confident work to date (though I must add, as a personal bias, that Sepet still has a special place in my heart).
SarahBrown	training	Yasmin	Through Mukshin the movie, we come full circle with the characters, and the world that ██████ has introduced us to.
SarahBrown	training	Orked	There are 2 additional family dynamics seen, one from an immediate neighbour, and the other from Mukhsin's own, both of which serve as adequate subplots, and contrast to █████'s own.
SarahBrown	training	Orked	Fans will definitely see the many links in Mukhsin back to the earlier movies, while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain whys and significance of recurring characters or events, like that pudgy boy who steals glances at █████.
SarahBrown	training	Yasmin	And speaking of whys, parts of Mukhsin too is curiously open, which probably is distinctive of ██████'s style, or deliberately left as such.
SarahBrown	training	Shepard	This is an odd film that works, an impressive effort for writer-director ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Kinnear	███████ is equally good as the salesman, a decent fellow with a void in his life.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	█████ is fine as Kinnear's flirtatious wife.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy's	"""The Golden Child"" was ██████████████ first film since his megahit ""Beverly Hills Cop""."
SarahBrown	training	Murphy	██████ stars as a finder of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case.
SarahBrown	training	Sergei Urusevsky's	██████████████████ camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated.
SarahBrown	training	Wifes	You may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to The Stepford █████, but this is an absolute classic.
SarahBrown	training	Ahista Ahista	█████████████ is one little small brilliant.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay Deol	There's one very good reason the film got this feel, and it's the fresh talent called ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ankush	He is extremely convincing as the simple, kind-hearted and struggling ██████, whose new love motivates him to make amends and fight for a better life.
SarahBrown	training	Deol	████ portrays all the different shades of his character, whether positive or negative, naturally and with complete ease.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay	Except for █████, the rest of the cast performed well.
SarahBrown	training	Soha Ali Khan	Though █████████████ did not stand out according to me, she was good and had some of her mother's charm.
SarahBrown	training	Himesh Reshammiya's	The film's biggest weakness was ███████████████████ uninspiring music which was unsuitable for this film.
SarahBrown	training	Ahista Ahista	Otherwise, █████████████ was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay Deol's	In short, this movie really grows on you slowly, and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing, the moving moments, the charming romance, the realistic proceedings, and of course ████████████ memorable performance.
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	It is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially ███████████████ in her debut role.
SarahBrown	training	Tobias Wolff	The topics it addresses are ugly, cynical, and at times, even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, artful with its camera angles, and gorgeous in its style, skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories, ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Noonan	This movie, of its own volition, has created in me the same feelings the main character (██████████) felt when words transformed his very existence, and that is one impressive feat.
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	████████████ is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well; this remains her defining role.
SarahBrown	training	David Thewlis	Of the supporting cast I particularly liked █████████████ as the police detective.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	She deserves an █████ for best actress in a drama for this effort and it doesn't really matter what the competition was the year it was first shown.
SarahBrown	training	Keaton	The movie, overall was fairly well done, staged and shot well with a strong supporting cast but ██████ carried the load.
SarahBrown	training	Marcus Patrick	She goes to a club meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (greatfully played by ██████████████) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far.
SarahBrown	training	Maya	He also does drugs and ████ starts using as well.
SarahBrown	training	Jared	While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches █████ cheating.
SarahBrown	training	Will Maya	Or █████████ have a surprise for Jared?
SarahBrown	training	A. Rosario Dawson	Excellent █████████████████ portrays the role with focus and endurance.
SarahBrown	training	Chad Faust	██████████ does not like he can be a rapist, but he does a terrific job as Jared.
SarahBrown	training	Rebecca West's	just saw this exquisite 1982 movie Return of the Soldier, based on ██████████████ novel.
SarahBrown	training	Chris	It is SHE who is notified that █████ is back in England.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Christie	Kitty (██████████████) is vacuous and snobbish.
SarahBrown	training	Chris	Why, she asks herself, was this other woman sent a telegraph about █████ rather than her?
SarahBrown	training	Chris	█████ has forgotten totally about Kitty.
SarahBrown	training	Margaret	He wants to renew his relationship with ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Margaret	The now married ████████ is reluctant to meet him, but then does and continues to meet with him.
SarahBrown	training	Jenny	█████ wants to help.
SarahBrown	training	Chris	Late in the film Kitty reveals that █████ and she had a boy who died five years ago.
SarahBrown	training	Chris	Telling █████ this, weighs the Shrink, will certainly restore him to 'normal.'
SarahBrown	training	Chris	█████, barely aware that he and Kitty were ever married, is unaware of his child and the child's death.
SarahBrown	training	Chris	The psychiatrist, just learning of the child, believes such knowledge will restore █████.
SarahBrown	training	Chris	The film leaves her mostly out of consideration concerning whats to be done with █████.
SarahBrown	training	Margaret	She does not reveal this to ████████, however.
SarahBrown	training	Rebecca West	Fin I read some criticism of this first novel of ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Jenny	The movie is never quite clear who █████ is, his cousin or his sister.
SarahBrown	training	Yasmin Ahmad	That is what Malaysian filmmaker ████████████ aims to prove in her fourth feature, a movie where that most complex of emotions is recounted in a deceptively simple, straightforward fashion.
SarahBrown	training	Mukhsin	Then one day she meets ███████ (Naswip), who has come to spend the holidays at his aunt's house, and all of a sudden she changes her habits: goodbye fistfights, hello bike-riding and tree-climbing.
SarahBrown	training	Peggy	Young █████ arrives in Hollywood seeking stardom.
SarahBrown	training	e. g.	"""Crush"" examines female friendship, for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme (█████, ""Steel Magnolias"")."
SarahBrown	training	Ceasar Romero	█████████████ is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks she's dating the millionaire whose car I just mentioned.
SarahBrown	training	Vera-Ellen	What I've just mentioned may be confusing but (mostly) makes sense if you're willing to check your brain while watching this charmingly screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers as performed by the exquisite Ms. ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Vera-Ellen	And ██████████ does pretty well with her lines since she's not really an actress.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Reeve	█████████████████ plays a ex-con who happens into town looking for work.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Reeve	"And if you liked █████████████████ in ""Somewhere in Time"" you'll like him in this one also."
SarahBrown	training	Catherine	The sequel takes place in London, where █████████ has now relocated.
SarahBrown	training	Catherine Trammel	Both bustling cities known for excitement, haute couture ~ and a perfect place for someone like █████████████████ to take residency.
SarahBrown	training	Karloff	███████ and Lugosi - Together again!
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	Just as ██████ went wild in The Raven, much needs to be said of Karloff's hamming in The Invisible Ray.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	The one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that Karloff's character, ████, acts so madly before he is poisoned by Radium X, that there really isn't much of a change once he starts glowing.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Nicholson	This is very similar to the complaint people have about ██████████████ in The Shining -
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	I still enjoyed his performance, though, just as I did ██████'s over-the-top antics in The Raven.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	"And if he (████) touches anyone?"""
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	Just as ██████ could be so off, he could also be more perfect than any actor.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	Karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times, however, one wishes ██████ would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	The Invisible Ray is a fun film, and a real treat to the true Karloff and ██████ fans.
SarahBrown	training	John Fulton	The special effects, by the always innovative ███████████, are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate.
SarahBrown	training	Frances Drake	█████████████ looks as beautiful as she did in Mad Love and plays a strong woman, something seldom seen in classic horror films.
SarahBrown	training	Karloff	The scene in the end when ███████ stalks her
SarahBrown	training	John Williams	The production quality, cast, premise, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) locale and lush █████████████ score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item.
SarahBrown	training	Jane Fonda	██████████ was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable.
SarahBrown	training	Robert DiNiro's	███████████████ character was just a bit too contrived.
SarahBrown	training	Schmidt	"This genre has been more successfully handled by ""Nobody's Fool"" in the mid 90s and this year's (2003) ""About ███████."""
SarahBrown	training	Robert Bloch	The late, great ████████████ (author of PSYCHO, for those of you who weren't paying attention) scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies I ever saw as a kid.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Bukowski	Downbeat (in a petit-bourgeois sort of way), philosophical and blackly humorous, the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual ████████████████ (no disrespect to CB intended).
SarahBrown	training	Boris Karloff	In this entry the dominant role goes to █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	████ impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to Africa to find the mysterious element.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	"████ goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names ""Radium X""."
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	Meanwhile ████ becomes contaminated by Radium X to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	████ goes to Benet for help.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	Unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects ████'s brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	When Benet informs him of this action, ████ accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge.
SarahBrown	training	Benet	When he returns to France he learns of the healing power of Radium X as he cures his mother's (Violet Kemble Cooper) blindness and of █████'s work in curing the maladies of his patients.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	But ████'s madness intensifies.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	First he murders an innocent man whom is identified as ████.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	This angers ████ and he begins to exact his revenge on the five other members of the expedition.
SarahBrown	training	Benet	One night he is lured into a trap set by █████ and...........
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	██████ has a straight role for once and does what he can with the limited part.
SarahBrown	training	Karloff	███████'s film all the way.
SarahBrown	training	Janos Rukh	Karloff, austere and embittered in his Carpathian mountain retreat, is ██████████, genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological pastparticularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in Africa.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	"Joining him is the ever-elegant ██████ (as a rare hero), who studies ""astro-chemistry."""
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	"Even better when mother ████ says, ""He broke the first law of science."""
SarahBrown	training	Meena Kumari's	This was the lovely ██████████████ film from start to finish, and I believe was planned by her from 1958 on, finally realising it in 1971.
SarahBrown	training	Pakeezah	 Because of all this but not blind to its faults, ████████ is my favourite Indian movie, filmed at a time when the Westernisation of India was gathering pace and watched now when Western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur.
SarahBrown	training	Pakeezah	"At the very least watch ████████ for a taste of what Indian ""pop"" music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines, the Bollywood Beat and bhangra."
SarahBrown	training	Jamie Foxx	 Most of that, I think, is due to ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Foxx	I don't know who tagged ████ for the lead, but whoever it was did this movie a big favor.
SarahBrown	training	Foxx	Believable and amazingly likeable, ████ glides through the movie, smooth as butter and funnier than hell.
SarahBrown	training	Jessica Alba	████████████ does a great job, it's about time we have a kick-ass girl who's not the cutesy type.
SarahBrown	training	Mina Kumari	███████████ exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing, to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies.
SarahBrown	training	J.Q.	████
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dickens'	"You could stage a version of ████████████████ ""A Christmas Carol"" with sock puppets and I'll probably watch it."
SarahBrown	training	Scott	█████ has made Scrooge utterly believable and painfully human.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	Impressive as █████'s performance is, the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version's dark beauty.
SarahBrown	training	Fred Holywell	█████████████, Scrooge's nephew, is an excellent example of this.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Rees	Often portrayed as an affable buffoon, here he is played by ██████████ with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	"When he implores ███████, ""I ask nothing of you."
SarahBrown	training	Marley	In most versions of this tale, the scene with ██████ tends to be a bit of a low point in the film, simply because it's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly, and the results are usually just plain silly (ooooh, look, it's a scary ghost.......not!)
SarahBrown	training	Marley	██████'s entrance, as the locks on Scrooge's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house, is wonderfully creepy.
SarahBrown	training	Marley	██████ may be a ghost, but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth, and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress, are still very human.
SarahBrown	training	Edward Woodward	███████████████ (remember him from the Equalizer?) is by turns both jovial and menacing as the Ghost of Christmas Present.
SarahBrown	training	Santa Claus	"When he delivers the famous line, ""it may well be that in the sight of Heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than MILLIONS like this poor man's child"" he is no longer a jolly ███████████ surrogate, but an avenging angel who gives Scrooge a much needed verbal spanking."
SarahBrown	training	Rooney	██████ is a great dancer, who cares if he is gay.
SarahBrown	training	Jazmine	Whacky Canadians.....███████ is rhyming too much, she must be Dutch.
SarahBrown	training	Gackt	I'm a fan of both actors/singers especially █████ and when I first discover this movie and watch the trailer,I just think this is a silly one.
SarahBrown	training	Peck	Most Bible-based movies are basically schlock- what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how ████, tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying Neanderthals all about him.
SarahBrown	training	Judaism	"The story wasn't entirely fresh (felt like a remnant of ""Running Man"" with the whole television show idea), but the attitude towards Christianity and ███████ about how the public picks their Messiah certainly sounded true enough."
SarahBrown	training	Raymond Massey	██████████████ as the prophet Nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance.
SarahBrown	training	gore	There is a slightly awkward gear change somewhere in the middle of the film when tension thriller mutates into ████ fest, but nothing so clumsy as to slow the hectic pace.
SarahBrown	training	Kate	Some may find themselves feeling somewhat cheated of a clear explanation as to the exact nature and history of the threat encountered by ████ and her confederates, however, for me this was not the case.
SarahBrown	training	Mardi Gras	██████████: Made in China provides a wonderful, intricate connection between popular culture, nudity, and globalization through the making and tossing of beads.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff Wincott	████████████ is terrific in the film!
SarahBrown	training	Steve Gordon	████████████ crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm-hearted tone of the story.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	"This, the original ""██████"", is a classic comedy that is one for the books."
SarahBrown	training	Roger Corman's	I have to admit that these types of films generally aren't my favourites; but in fact the idea of women behind bars has been done very well on several occasions outside of Italy and Spain; and ██████████████ New World Pictures is responsible for some of the best of them.
SarahBrown	training	McQueen	This prison is ruled over by the stuff wheelchair bound Superintendent ███████; and she takes offence to a play put on by the girls; leading them to plot an escape.
SarahBrown	training	Barbara Steele	The film is helped along by assured direction from the man who would go on to helm the masterpiece The Silence of the Lambs and a great cast with plenty of standouts; including best of all the legendary ██████████████ in the role of the head prison warden.
SarahBrown	training	jim davis	█████████ gives an excellent performance in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Denzel Washington's	Being that this is ███████████████████ first ever movie that he himself was gonna direct, i have to admit i was a tad sceptical, but who wouldn't be..?
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	(The story is based on the life of ██████████████, born 3.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff	Now ████ only has to get it back and drive it through the U.S. Canadian border to Dawson.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Stewart	It's fantastic to watch how █████████████ overcome's all the troubles in his way.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	It focuses on ███████, a roguish handsome German Shepard who may seem unlikable to some at first... but eventually will win you over.
SarahBrown	training	Don Bluth	A treat for █████████ fans and animation buffs.
SarahBrown	training	My Neighbor Totoro	Along with Watership Down and ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Dooley	The movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill ██████ for the way he treated him in the past.
SarahBrown	training	Dooley	There is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of ██████'s wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area.
SarahBrown	training	James Belushi	The first reason is because I am a big █████████████ fan and the second is for the action sequences.
SarahBrown	training	James Belushi	█████████████ is funnier than he was in K-9 and the action sequences at are better too.
SarahBrown	training	James Belushi	If you are a █████████████ fan, you'll love this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Dietrich	There is no ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	"There is only █████████████""; and there is, thank heavens!"
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	█████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	It's a shame █████████████ was blackballed by Hollywood when she came back to the States--so much talent cast so arrogantly by the wayside!
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	In the film, in addition to getting to watch █████████████ in action, it's great to see pictures of Paris ca.
SarahBrown	training	Piaf	1930 and to hear ████'s young voice.
SarahBrown	training	Sergio Martino's	████████████████ The Case of the Scorpion's Tail is a scenic giallo from the early 70's heyday of the genre.
SarahBrown	training	Ernesto Gastaldi	Scorpion's Tail plays the mystery element, written by giallo specialist ████████████████, fairly straight.
SarahBrown	training	Martino	The photography is helped by the nice use of foreign locales - in this case London and Athens - where ███████ manages to get in, respectively, the Houses of Parliament and the Acropolis!
SarahBrown	training	Martino	So ███████'s film is influential in its own right.
SarahBrown	training	NoShame	The DVD release by ███████ is nice.
SarahBrown	training	CJ	I think ██ is very funny
SarahBrown	training	Grandad	and I love his scenes with ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Harris	The lighting and shot angles in some of ██████' scenes make his face look truly diabolical.
SarahBrown	training	James Eves	The film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast, and excellent direction by ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Stephanie Beecham	The movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from █████████████████ and everyone is perfectly cast.
SarahBrown	training	James Eves	██████████ has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action, fall and then rise to a climax.
SarahBrown	training	gore	This is a return of the old vampire movie, with loads of ████, blood and screams.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Steele	The performances are incredible, especially ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba the Hutt	 The starting point of the movie was almost like Episode IV--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place, where the seriousness of mobster ██████████████ was getting even more serious.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	He ordered ████ to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of Bantha, who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	████'s Jedi powers eventually finish the monster off.
SarahBrown	training	Lando	Once it fired, the rebel fleet's only hope was that the Death Star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out, and this affected █████ so much because he wanted to destroy the Death Star
SarahBrown	training	Lando	And it was taken out with █████'s increasing impatience.
SarahBrown	training	Chewbacca	For instance, █████████, as well as another Ewok, was able to commandeer one of the walkers (and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers), and the other Ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	On the home movie version, I think █████ himself wanted a different ending.
SarahBrown	training	Cher	well, ████ always looks a little odd.
SarahBrown	training	Alain Delon	"███████████ visits swift, sure vengeance on the ruthless crime family that employed him as a hit-man in the Duccio Tessari thriller ""Big Guns"" after they accidentally murder his wife and child."
SarahBrown	training	Alain Delon	"███████████ of ""The Godson"" is appropriately laconic as he methodically deals out death to the heads of the mob families who refused to let him retire so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter."
SarahBrown	training	Tessari	███████ does not waste a second in this 90-minute shoot'em up.
SarahBrown	training	Moon Child	You can tell what side I'm on with ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Max	Imperfect, as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget, but the drama is involving-- it's one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on Cinemax 2 or More ███ or whatever they call it, you end up watching 40 minute blocks when you're supposed to be going to work.
SarahBrown	training	Wynorski	"Along W/ ""Deathstalker 2"", ""Chopping Mall"", and ""The Assault"", a reminder that ████████ is a much more talented director than many of his fellow low-budget brethern, who has a real ability to pace a genre film, when he actually's interested in the material (i.e., don't bother watching any of his Shannon Tweed flicks with a 3 or a 4 after the title!)"
SarahBrown	training	Citizen Kane	"Not ""████████████,"" and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive, but a well-written, character-driven above-average straight-to-video actioner."
SarahBrown	training	Albert Pyun	"Small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along, which is rare enough (as I was reminded as I tried to sit through an ███████████ monstrosity called ""Heatseeker"" the other night -- this low-budget stuff isn't as easy as it looks -- but that's another story!)"
SarahBrown	training	Jill Dunne	██████████ has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often.
SarahBrown	training	Olivia	There are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter ██████ dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs.
SarahBrown	training	Olivia	In many ways, ██████ does an outstanding performance as the teenage and Nick Mancuso,(Richard Grant) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner.
SarahBrown	training	Randy Quaid	I can't believe this only has a 5.9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion, and it was funny seeing ███████████ in this type of role, plus this is extremely well written and made as well!.
SarahBrown	training	Kagan	One scene that really got to me was when Madge(Marilyn █████), is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party, and the film has many surprising moments as well!, plus the dialog is especially excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Adrian Lyne	███████████ does a fantastic job here, with awesome camera work, and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace!.
SarahBrown	training	Cherie Currie	█████████████ is way hot, and is amazing here, i really felt sorry for her character, as she had a very likable character that just needed help, she gives a powerful performance, and created a very memorable character she was amazing!.
SarahBrown	training	Randy Quaid	███████████ is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him.
SarahBrown	training	Sally Kellerman	███████████████ is great as the mother i liked her a lot.
SarahBrown	training	Laura Dern	██████████ has a very early role here, as it was cool to see her, not much of a part though.
SarahBrown	training	Cybill Shepherd	███████████████ was given great reviews for her role, and they were well deserved.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	████ goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while Corinne tries to get on with hers.
SarahBrown	training	Joey	The whole entire movie is about The Ramones...especially ████!
SarahBrown	training	Joey Ramone	███████████ 1951-2001.
SarahBrown	training	Dee Dee Ramone	██████████████ 1952-2002!
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	It just sounds weird.), ███████ is tricked and murdered by Carfax.
SarahBrown	training	Dom Deluise	He still goes back to Earth and meets up with his old friend Itchy (███████████), and plans payback on Carfax.
SarahBrown	training	Anne Marie	Meanwhile, Carfax has a little orphan girl ██████████ held captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals, which helps predict races.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	███████ and Itchy free her, and try to help her find a family, while learning a lot about themselves.
SarahBrown	training	Hugh Grant	About time some one made a good young British comedy that didn't star ██████████ or forty something's.
SarahBrown	training	Luke Goss's	███████████ cameo was surprisingly very good, but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	The flawless filming stile, the acting and (███████'s all time number one skill) the music - make it THE masterpiece of horror.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	It starts slow (███████ trademark) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Also the film doesn't offer a lot of ████ (it has just enough
SarahBrown	training	Bobby	At first I was seriously scared because I was hoping that it would not end up like █████, which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it.
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	(And ███████████████, too, but I wasn't sure if he was playing at being a hack.)
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	███████████ is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays; many people are not even inclined to try, because of its reputation as Serious Literature and its archaic English.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Branagh's overacting, and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer, may detract from ███████████'s art somewhat, but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it, rather than nothing.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	"Some people are complaining that ""it's set in the 19th century and that wasn't ███████████'s time""."
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Well, in ███████████'s time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	███████████ may have SAID it's in the days of ancient Rome or medieval Denmark or whatever, but he didn't dress his characters up like they were, he used the costumes of his own time.
SarahBrown	training	Robin Hood's day	For example, in King John the English and French have cannons--in ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Warnerscope	I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called ███████████ which gave a very neat cinematography.
SarahBrown	training	Nicholas Ray	The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say ████████████, to increase its rhythm and tension.
SarahBrown	training	H.G. Wells	"Remember ██████████' ""The Invisible Man""?"
SarahBrown	training	Caine	And who else, but █████ would be the lab rat.
SarahBrown	training	Caine	So when the did █████, he decided to use it for fun.
SarahBrown	training	Caine	However, the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should, and █████ would delve into madness.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell's	and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for ██████████████ nipple..i truly was.
SarahBrown	training	Carell	the idea that they suspected that ██████ was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin.
SarahBrown	training	La Maman et la putain	Since my third or fourth viewing some time ago, I've abstained from █████████████████████ while I wait for the DVD.
SarahBrown	training	Le Père Noël	The latter ends with a frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, doc, and in-between, impossible to see or, in the cases of Mes petites amoureuses and ████████████..., re-see.
SarahBrown	training	Ditto Alphaville	████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	Is █████████'s a fairy tale?
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	█████████'s always choreographing himself, worrying about how or where to stand or walk, what to say when, announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does.
SarahBrown	training	Léaud	How different is the present █████?
SarahBrown	training	Irma Vep	Isn't he still doing it, whatever it is, in recent roles, ████████, Le Pornographe, whatever, approaching old age?
SarahBrown	training	Truffaut	████████ films.
SarahBrown	training	Léaud	For a long while, every three or five minutes, down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf, tweedy coat, █████ hair, with a direction-seeking nose.
SarahBrown	training	Park Chan Wook's	████████████████ direction was fantastic.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	Freely adapted from ███████’ novel, this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	But ██████ doesn’t settle particularly well into his new job, and escapes after a few troubled days.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	Despite the unlawful nature of the job, ██████ finds good friends among his new “family”.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	After many adventures, ██████ discovers his true ancestry and finds that he is actually from a rich and well-to-do background.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	“██████” is a brilliantly assembled film, consistently pleasing to the eye and excellently acted by its talented cast.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	Moody recreates his stage role with considerable verve, stealing the film from the youngsters with his energetic performance as █████.
SarahBrown	training	Masayuki Suo	████████████, who directed this fine film, is on a role.
SarahBrown	training	Naoto Takenaka	We both laugh often (██████████████ is hilarious, as he is in Suo's two previous films) and really root for the characters.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews Musical	Even a bad █████████████████████ is worth watching and this isn't bad!
SarahBrown	training	Julie	"To break █████'s ""goody two shoes mold"" she plays a German Spy/English Musical Hall Actress."
SarahBrown	training	Julie	We want to love █████
SarahBrown	training	Julie	█████ as a German Spy?
SarahBrown	training	Mary Poppins	Our ████████████?
SarahBrown	training	Maria Van Trapp	our ███████████████ suddenly a German Spy?
SarahBrown	training	Rock Hudson	Oh and did I mention hunky ███████████ is in it too?
SarahBrown	training	Julie	█████ gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss.
SarahBrown	training	Mancini	Great WW 1 Songs and nice tunes by ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Julie	For example, why is █████ and her uncle suddenly pursued by the Germans when a minute ago she was spying for them.
SarahBrown	training	Blake Edwards	It has the annoying idiot detectives that █████████████ puts in all his movies.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	" █████: ""I Will make you a German Spy, then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie."
SarahBrown	training	Maria Von Trapp	"It will be the death of ███████████████"" Fascinating study on changing an image."
SarahBrown	training	Wonderful Julie	███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Clinton	That is the reason the Feds became involved, he called ███████ and asked him to get the Feds involved in the case.
SarahBrown	training	Ann Marie	He claimed to love █████████ but all he wanted was someone that he could control.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	It deals with his stress of trying to perform a ███████████ each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young, able bodied ones being taken for military service.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	The two male leads both received █████ nominations for best actor and deservedly so.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama, theater--especially ███████████, or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity.
SarahBrown	training	Belleau Wood	Fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the U.S.S. ████████████ (LHA-3), a front line helicopter assault platform.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	"While set in the Navy, ""██████████████"" is not in any real sense a service story as was ""Men of Honor,"" an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person."
SarahBrown	training	Washington	"With all the Navy support people listed in the end credits, someone should have told Director ██████████ that his character, like all naval officers below the rank of commander, is addressed as ""Mister."""
SarahBrown	training	Bette Midler	"████████████ showcases her talents and beauty in ""Diva Las Vegas""."
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Picking up right after the Moscow-showdown of Supremacy, this is ██████'s greatest adventure and his final climax.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Throughout the tight, 115-min-runtime the movie takes ██████ from Russia to Madrid, Paris, Marocco and ultimately New York.
SarahBrown	training	Khouri	It's almost impossible to imagine what Ms. ██████ hoped to gain by appearing in this film: vindication?
SarahBrown	training	Anna Broinowski	Director ███████████████ appears increasingly on camera as her film progresses, and increasingly exasperated to boot; but she is finally rewarded with a remarkable, although scary and disturbing, tale to tell - and one of those films that reminds us what a thoroughly weird world it is we live in.
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino,(Mayor	████████████████
SarahBrown	training	"John Pappas),""Gigli"",'03"	████████████████████████, gave an outstanding performance through out the entire picture, and especially when he gave a speech at an African American Church for a little boy who was slain.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	"""Mr. █████████ Buildings his Dream House"" shows what 1940s Hollywood was capable of, and it's just screamingly funny."
SarahBrown	training	Ma	I didn't like the voice of Timon's ██.
SarahBrown	training	Simba	" Ups: We get to see █████ as a ""teenager."""
SarahBrown	training	Simba	They wasted it with a slug-slurping contest between Timon and █████.
SarahBrown	training	Tony Martin	The miniseries Blue Murder (which also starred ███████████, but as someone on the other side of the law) may be the exception.
SarahBrown	training	Gwynne	As the oldest ██████ though denying it kind of takes charge with the others grumbling, but going along.
SarahBrown	training	Hoyt Axton	██████████ as the local sheriff watches in amazement at what unfolds in his town.
SarahBrown	training	Murphy	 Disorganized Crime is one very funny caper movie, the kind of film that well known pessimist Mr. ██████ would have written.
SarahBrown	training	Merkerson	But, overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Alfred E. Neuman	I remember NOT seeing the ████████████████ depictions shown in the theatrical trailers.
SarahBrown	training	Ron Liebman	"When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the ""usual gang"" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which I'm sure they were, but to seriously find them ( and ███████████ ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised."
SarahBrown	training	Ron Liebman	And being a ███████████ fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?)
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone's	The only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic, is the fact that ██████████████ character is still alive and not in jail at this late date.
SarahBrown	training	David Morrissey's	█████████████████ analyst is killing these people for revenge.
SarahBrown	training	Stone	Thankfully (for █████) he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled home/working life of his own.
SarahBrown	training	Glass	However █████ is now too glassy-eyed to realise or care.
SarahBrown	training	Mike Tyson	Like a dizzy boxer in front of a prime-time ██████████ he ripe for the big take-down, however not before finding that Washburn might have a secret or two himself.
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte Rampling	Now comes Millena Gardosh (██████████████████) a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example (in this film) of someone who isn't barking mad or else a murder suspect.
SarahBrown	training	Stone	Strangely she doesn't think █████ is quite as dangerous as everyone else - or else she doesn't think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper acting.
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino	No character seems out of place and █████████ is brilliant as always.
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino	His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is superb and proves again that █████████ belongs to the absolute top of American actors nowadays.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Costner	I only went to see this movie because I have always liked █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton	I felt that ██████ did a great job in the Butterfly Effect.
SarahBrown	training	WWI	"To me this is one of the five best movies about ███ (the others are ""All Quiet On The Western Front"", ""Paths Of Glory"", ""Gallipoli"" and the post-war ""La vie et rien d'autre"")."
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino	In a role he was born to play, █████████ stars as New York's mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Verhoeven	Oh, yes, it's missing the intelligence that ██████████████ is known for in his sci-fi movies.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Bacon	I would have enjoyed seeing the invisible ███████████ robbing a bank and getting away with it, or let's say steal something from people's purses, or something like that.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) are driving down to Florida, on their way they meet 2 guys (Turner, █████), they really add nothing to the plot, but are at least somewhat likable.
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino	The mayor is perfect due to the embodiment █████████ offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas's	This final entry in ██████████████ STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	█████, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of █████'s court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where ████ discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks.
SarahBrown	training	Warrick Davis	However, their leader, Wicket (played by █████████████) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.
SarahBrown	training	John Williams'	And yes, there's also ██████████████ music.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	"In 1997, ████████████ re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) ""Special Editions"", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements."
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	"""Jedi Rocks"" musical number in █████'s Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film."
SarahBrown	training	Altman	Having only seen two of his pictures previously, I've come to terms with ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Dooley's	And █████████████ stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	A strange role for ████████████ to take at the height of his career.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	"While there is a lot of the ""████████████ character,"" he plays a truly decent person."
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte Lewis	The rest of the cast is good, particularly the lovely ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Helmer	I was thinking... how it will be possible to continue the story without ██████ and Drusse? ...
SarahBrown	training	Lars	I think ████ should make RIGET III a little bit different.
SarahBrown	training	Helmer	I'm sure that 3rd part without ██████ wouldn't be the same.
SarahBrown	training	Lars	I know that ████ likes to experiment.
SarahBrown	training	Trey Parker	"I think the only solution here is to create puppet-driven animation (like for example ""team America"" by ███████████) or even computer 3d animation."
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	I had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when I stumbled upon when I was searching for other films that stared ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Dom	I thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what his/her mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep,it was an interesting film and a good part was played by ███.......I believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere (well I've never seen it anywhere)
SarahBrown	training	Bourn	#2-The █████ Ultimatum, which I have seen, awesome movie but 3rd week out, average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say).
SarahBrown	training	Wallace	As we watch ███████'s rather dull life proceeding, suddenly there comes something new and jarring: a traveling carnival comes to town.
SarahBrown	training	Wilder Napalm	One of its stars is █████████████, Wallace's brother.
SarahBrown	training	Wallace	So does ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Wilder	Wallace keeps his powers secret; ██████ lets his acquaintances know what he can do.
SarahBrown	training	Wilder	Complicating the matter, ██████ wants Wallace's wife, whom they both dated years earlier.
SarahBrown	training	Riget II	████████ is a good sequel, but not quite as good as the first one.
SarahBrown	training	Drusse	Mrs. ██████ is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done, but fate want's it otherwise.
SarahBrown	training	Helmer	She is soon chasing ghosts and ██████ is doing everyone mad
SarahBrown	training	Trier	The hand-held camera that made █████ world famous gives suspense and reality to the series.
SarahBrown	training	Trier	It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and █████ makes use of these abilities.
SarahBrown	training	Henry Winkler	It's a very beautiful sweet movie, █████████████ did a GREAT job with his character and it really impressed me.
SarahBrown	training	Kenny Doughty	I think █████████████ looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable, but reasonable plot.
SarahBrown	training	Doughty	McDowell's character, the headmistress, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist, filling in for the regular player (███████) catches her eye.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Vidor	This is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Jerome Kern's	"█████████████ music is heard through out the entire picture and the song, ""Long Ago & Far Away"" is the theme music for this musical."
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	████████ provides us with a moving atmosphere, with Campbell's despair building up and almost choking the viewer.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	"█████ plays the role of his life, in my opinion; he is even better than in ""Affliction"", although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self-destruction."
SarahBrown	training	Sheryl Lee	██████████ is also excellent, and the same can be said for the whole cast in general.
SarahBrown	training	Des Brady	█████████ (the directors brother?) was especially good.
SarahBrown	training	Yashimo	███████.
SarahBrown	training	Monica Gayle	One of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was ████████████, who had a small but fanatic cult of followers.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	████ talks about Berlin in 1943 where the Gestapo would hold all the Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse Street even though they are supposed to have immunity for being married to Aryans and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release.
SarahBrown	training	Margarethe von Trotta	This film is directed by █████████████████████ who is making her first feature film in almost 10 years after working in television and while this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in Europe.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	████████'s words are best experienced on paper.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	Mother night is probably one of the three novels ████████ has written I could take to a desert island, along with Slaughterhouse-5 and Bluebeard.
SarahBrown	training	Fonda	I haven't always been a fan of █████'s work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time.
SarahBrown	training	De Niro	███████ has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks'	Originally conceived as a silent, it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France, with a French actress speaking ██████████████ lines, but was released as a silent in Italy and other parts of Europe.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	I haven't seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying, since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done (█████████████ is clearly speaking English, so there's no way her lips could be matched.)
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	█████████████, of course, is responsible for saving the film from obscurity.
SarahBrown	training	Lustrously	██████████ beautiful, she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural yet highly charged performance.
SarahBrown	training	Lucienne Garnier	She plays ████████████████, a typist with a possessive fiancé, who yearns to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest, with immediate success.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	█████████████ may never have looked more beautiful than she does here, with the projector's beam flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders swathed in white fur, her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen.
SarahBrown	training	James Cameron	The concept of Dark Angel isn't anything new (in fact, there's controversy over whether █████████████ stole the idea from a book), but I spend the entire hour watching it every Tuesday from start to finish.
SarahBrown	training	Dark Angel	"In my opinion, ██████████ is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for, but if you're looking for hard hitting, award-winning drama, go watch ""The West Wing"" or something."
SarahBrown	training	Robert Downey Jr.'s	At any rate, what movie can lack with ███████████████████ puppy-dog eyes?
SarahBrown	training	Robert Downey Jr.	But like I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with █████████████████
SarahBrown	training	Lee-Hom	They're doing a great job, and with no earlier experience in movies (except for ███████, who had been in two movies before).
SarahBrown	training	Hyde	Maybe that's a little because I'm a very big fan of ████, but - it was this movie who made me discover him.
SarahBrown	training	Kei	After that people are dying, ███'s leaving and it all changes so much.
SarahBrown	training	Mukhsin	Yes I agree that the boy (███████) did his acting very good.
SarahBrown	training	Yasmin	And salute to ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Yasmin	We can see how ██████ really appreciated her parents in an unique way.
SarahBrown	training	Abbas	Does it hurt to attempt some originality, █████?
SarahBrown	training	Salman - Rani	The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (█████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Preity Zinta	They pick Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Salman	██████ acts very well.
SarahBrown	training	Preity	The film belongs to ██████, who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance.
SarahBrown	training	Abydos	This series is set a year after the mission to ██████ in the movie Stargate.
SarahBrown	training	Ra	Where did the Goa'uld (██'s race) come from?
SarahBrown	training	Samantha Carter	We meet ███████████████, a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the Stargate the first time, and is determined to go through now.
SarahBrown	training	Daniel	Then ██████'s wife gets captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen.
SarahBrown	training	Jaffa	They get captured, and just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a █████ named Teal'c, First Prime of Apophis, saves them and goes to Earth with them, where he is made part of SG-1.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Corman	Yes, it is released by ████████████, and yes, it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY.
SarahBrown	training	Amanda	The twist of the stepfather abuse of ██████ in the past (again, very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting.
SarahBrown	training	Amanda	I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for ██████'s plight this aspect of the story elicits.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	█████ leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	█████ is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family.
SarahBrown	training	Kalatozov	(For anyone interested in film technique another movie by █████████, I AM CUBA, has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana, rises two stories to a cigar factory, tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long, long avenue - all without a cut.)
SarahBrown	training	Samoilova	A devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Conchatta Ferrell	█████████████████ is just wonderful.
SarahBrown	training	Barker	"At that, ██████ yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....YANK 'EM OUT!"""
SarahBrown	training	Jacky Chan	"The ""dragon lord"" (██████████) and his buddy, ""cowboy"", totally made the movie fun, meaningful, and just plain silly."
SarahBrown	training	Long Shao Ye	"████████████ takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young ""dragon lord"" (so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and ""cowboy"", which include implementing clever, elaborate ways to escape studying (with the help of the entire household, including the tutor), competing in rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to gain the affection of a local girl, competing in ""soccer"" (you will see what i mean) and the list goes on."
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter(RIP	This being some of(the others are film roles) the last work of ███████████████), one hopes that it is hilarious.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Hennessy	He plays █████████████, the father of three teenagers:
SarahBrown	training	Three	The show changed somewhat after Mr. █████'s Company passed on, and for a while, they couldn't seem to make up their minds if they wanted to go for getting laughs, or being poignant and making sure to be respectful.
SarahBrown	training	David Spade	One can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that: It could still be quite good, some of the additions were fortunate(if you like ███████████, most of his part consists of him doing his schtick) and had stuff to say.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Don't expect ████, or zombies.
SarahBrown	training	Bernard Rose	This is psychological, and just as he would also do in Candyman, ████████████ manages to convey the horror that is not being believed.
SarahBrown	training	Cousteau	I only recently discovered that it was a ████████ film and that blew my mind even more.
SarahBrown	training	Chloe Franks	The most outstanding contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old ████████████ who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold.
SarahBrown	training	Warren William	The main reason to see this film is ██████████████, who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager.
SarahBrown	training	William	███████ is a great actor --
SarahBrown	training	Bette Davis	███████████ as his girlfriend also shines in an under-written role.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	I wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the █████ saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge.
SarahBrown	training	Gregor Jordan	█████████████ said in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	As Utopian as it seems, I do believe people like █████████ could help society in many ways in a broader aspect.
SarahBrown	training	Ruben Santiago Hudson	It is based on a one man play by █████████████████████..yes he played most of the parts.
SarahBrown	training	Halle Berry	███████████ even produced it.
SarahBrown	training	Oprah	The only name I didn't see was █████'s ,thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a Hallmark movie.
SarahBrown	training	Pauline	It was moving but not phony, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, ███████ and the writer in question.
SarahBrown	training	Bill Crosby	The movie revolved around the universe of Nanny, Mrs ███████████ and how she raised the writer and took in people.
SarahBrown	training	Lou Gosset	But no she explains to ██████████ she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time.
SarahBrown	training	Terrence Howard	███████████████ was born to play these type of parts.
SarahBrown	training	Jeffery Wright	But for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Where is this mans █████?
SarahBrown	training	Carman Ejogo	His wife ████████████ was excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Castro	"Sunday July 16, 8:00pm The ██████, San Francisco ""As a Southern colonel your make-up is very Indiana"" The yammering gossips of Hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in Marion Davies direction over the years."
SarahBrown	training	Mabel Normand	Left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	von Stroheim	with ████████████, Walsh and DeMille.
SarahBrown	training	Billy	"What she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball, but a job is a job and █████ convinces her "" . ."
SarahBrown	training	Charlie Chaplin	███████████████, who asks for her autograph!
SarahBrown	training	Billy	She pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified █████ grabs the book and makes her sign.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	It's so very funny, considering ██████ character isn't supposed to recognize this guy!
SarahBrown	training	Vidor	█████ throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot (and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder, facing the camera!)
SarahBrown	training	Billy	█████ runs into the High Art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming, with predictably nutty results.
SarahBrown	training	Irving Thalberg	While it's true Show People is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence, it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from MGM, ███████████████, and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent.
SarahBrown	training	Bette Midler's	First off, I would just like to say what a big fan of ██████████████ I am.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Ebert	███████████ gave is 3 1/2 stars!
SarahBrown	training	Jason Scott Lee	███████████████ being one of them.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	As a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like ████.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	They test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle ███████ is injured and assumed to be dead.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	The military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that ███████ is alive.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	████ finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	Just as ███████'s leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like ████ and the other old soldiers.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	The military starts realizing this and ████ kills all of their men but one.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	███████ obviously comes out on top.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	"The writer also didn't forget that ███████ had never seen a woman before as he calls even women ""sir""."
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Russell	This is highly recommended for all ████████████ fans and action/sci-fi fans.
SarahBrown	training	Hal Sparks	I can't believe how many people hate ██████████!
SarahBrown	training	Hal Sparks	 Anyway, for all the people who dislike ██████████, I imagine they must have never seen the weekend specials.
SarahBrown	training	Talk Soup	They were hour long episodes of █████████ that comprised the best clips from the entire week, and were padded out by sketch comedy bits.
SarahBrown	training	Hal Sparks	The original bits that ██████████ did were hilarious.
SarahBrown	training	Hal Sparks	One episode was dedicated to making fun of Multiplicity, as a bunch of cloned ██████████ kept multiplying through out the episode, over-running the studio.
SarahBrown	training	Talk Soup	OK, maybe these don't sound as funny when I describe them, but all I know is that besides █████████, the only other two shows I watched consistently during those years was The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brian.
SarahBrown	training	Talk Soup	So if you like the comedy stylings of those shows, then you'd probably like █████████ during the Sparks years.
SarahBrown	training	Tyler	Of course, throughout the █████ and guest star years, my interest in this show began to wane, but every now and then I catch The Soup, the show's spiritual successor, and sure enough, the new host can bring some pretty unexpected laughs from time to time.
SarahBrown	training	Georges	Although ███████ is mentally handicapped, you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end, when love gives you directions not the brain.
SarahBrown	training	Forrest Gump	The film is as good as ████████████ in my belief.
SarahBrown	training	Majid Majidi	"""Rang-e khoda"" (The Color of The God) by ████████████ is another example of such foreign movies, almost with similar taste."
SarahBrown	training	Petzold	But then - this is part of ███████'s game: he plays along with the rules of genre.
SarahBrown	training	Freud	"It's a reverie, sorts of - so apt enough there are a lot of motives, █████ might have found interesting for his dream analysis, like all the ""doppelganger""-constellations."
SarahBrown	training	Gespenster	"To describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphaned mother, who searches Europe for her lost daughter, clearly doesn't say much about the nature of ""██████████"" at all."
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	"Now to the film, what I say will contain ""spoilers"" and if you don't mind, here goes:  █████████ is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo."
SarahBrown	training	Marie	He lives with an older woman called █████.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	████ spends his days at cafés and restaurants.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	The story reveals that ████ had previously impregnated Gilberte whom he used to live with.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	Gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because ████ had abused and battered her.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	At this point, ████ was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out Gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	Veronika fell in love with ████ for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	█████████ will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family.
SarahBrown	training	Audrey Evans	It's just amazing as one candidate ████████████ said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	████ joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise.
SarahBrown	training	James Stewart	Good old all American █████████████ appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Boyer	Had I been casting the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Margaret Sullavan	█████████████████ was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her.
SarahBrown	training	Clark Gable	I think only ███████████ was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	███████ in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out.
SarahBrown	training	Morgan	Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after ██████ starts asking people for opinions.
SarahBrown	training	Schildkraut	You really hate people like that, I've known too many like ███████████ in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day.
SarahBrown	training	Bernard Rose's	Is a good word to sum up ██████████████ brilliantly haunting and poetic Paperhouse.
SarahBrown	training	Bernard Rose's	██████████████ visuals are brilliant here.
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte Burke	The acting is of young ███████████████ in this, her feature debut, is a truly impressing as well.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	Classic film funny ████████████ of the 80s.
SarahBrown	training	Murphy	The classic irony of ██████ does not fail, the film is funny, well done.
SarahBrown	training	Murphy	A nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic ██████, an actor who has recently disappeared.
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey's	██████████████ character is over-the-top entertaining, and the librarian motif won't be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and stacks world.
SarahBrown	training	Tanya Roberts	I loved watching █████████████ besides Charlie's Angels.
SarahBrown	training	Turners	The ███████ are not dummies and I hope they create more shows like this in the future.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	The biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book, █████ is hanged--an ending very different from this musical film.
SarahBrown	training	Mark Lester's	By the way, when I saw the film again tonight, I was surprised by just how high and feminine █████████████ singing was for the film.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone	I think I love that it is a true story written by ███████ himself just as much as I love the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Denzel Washington	█████████████████ is one of my favorite actors.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff Wincott	"This movie (with the alternate title ""Martial Law 3"" for some reason) introduced me to ████████████ for the first time."
SarahBrown	training	Brigitte Nielsen	And for the rest of the cast: ████████████████ was a good choice for the villain.
SarahBrown	training	Matthias Hues	█████████████ also did a good job, as always.
SarahBrown	training	Wincott	He's a great fighter and macho-like character, and was a good rival for ███████ in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Hines	Mr. █████ succeeds in doing so.
SarahBrown	training	Hastings	I bought this while I was playing chess in ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Can ██████ finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good?
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The only real downer is that this, like the other ██████ films, has little to do with the original novel but unless you're a die-hard Ludlum fan, this isn't really any real reason to dislike a movie like this of the very highest calibre.
SarahBrown	training	Jason Bourne	Missing out of the ████████████ movies is a crime worthy of rendition - go and get yourself a copy of the DVD.
SarahBrown	training	Amilee	This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are ██████ and My Life As a Dog.
SarahBrown	training	Anne Brontes	████████████ epic novel THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and peoples living rooms.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	I'm sure ████ herself would have been happy with the way it was produced.
SarahBrown	training	Mitch	Despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both █████ and Jan Sterling in unflattering tones, it's a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier Blood on the Moon as his 'town tamer' sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to  possibly  be almost as bad as the men he dispatches.
SarahBrown	training	George Burns	I had heard that ████████████ was in this movie and that he won an Academy Award for it.
SarahBrown	training	George Burns	I have been a fan of ████████████ since I was ten.
SarahBrown	training	George Burns	████████████ did a great job.
SarahBrown	training	Walter	So did ██████ Matthau(this is the first time I've ever seen him perform).
SarahBrown	training	Martin Luther King	Besides, what other movies have cameos by ██████████████████, Jr?
SarahBrown	training	hunt	To decipher the film, ████ down the director's book entitled I Was Curious.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Still being of school age, and having to learn ███████████ almost constantly for the last four years (which is very off-putting of any writer, no matter how good), I didn't really expect to enjoy this film when my English teacher put it on; I thought it'd be the typical English lesson movie: bad acting, awfully shot, badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog, so, as you can tell, I was all but ready to go into a coma from the go.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	and it really brings to life what I expect ███████████ wanted his plays to be like (well, with the difference that this is cinema) much better than my English teacher harking over the text ever possibly could.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	The story is good, the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring (though a little hard to keep up with if you aren't used to ███████████'s language) and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn't expect; mainly, perhaps, due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh	███████████████ excels as Hamlet, bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll, but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes, making the movie as a whole much more watchable.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh	The other major players are also good, but it is ███████████████ who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	The set pieces, too, are often quite stunning, giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we're used to seeing in ███████████ productions, as well as a real sense of the country around them.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Of course, the movie, taken as a movie in its own right, is not without faults, but no major ones (the pacing is the only real problem I can think of offhand, as well as the prose for anyone not used to, as I said, Shakesperean language) and, especially when compared to the sort of ███████████ productions I'm used to seeing in class, it really is quite brilliant.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	It's even made me rethink my previous typical teenager stance on ███████████, that his plays are boring (I came to the conclusion it's not the plays that are boring, merely the teachers who recite them in class).
SarahBrown	training	Brian Krause	When I first found out that ████████████ was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	█████████████ was lovely in this film, her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful!
SarahBrown	training	Broken Bow	And, the first episode, ██████████, did have some problems.
SarahBrown	training	Zephram Cochran	"My favorite line: ███████████████ saying ""where no man has gone before"" (not ""no one"")"
SarahBrown	training	kaiser	excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal ██████ ordered struck.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and ██████!
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	however is that ██████! is immeasurably better!
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	The first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust ██████!.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	This movie is dynamic, topical, relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown Gangs of New York, ██████! offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century London, England that evokes sympathy without being condescending.
SarahBrown	training	SG1	'Stargate; ███' is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 'Star Trek' as the kings of sci-fi.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher	███████████ Judge is excellent as the aloof Teal'c, who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety.
SarahBrown	training	O'Neill	Almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence, reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs (often shown through arguments between ███████ and Jackson).
SarahBrown	training	SG1	███ also excels in humour, from O'Neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd!
SarahBrown	training	SG1	███ has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death.
SarahBrown	training	P.J. Soles	She butts head with Riff Randall (██████████) who LOVES the Ramones.
SarahBrown	training	Woronov	What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and ███████ (who is REALLY enjoying herself).
SarahBrown	training	Amelie	As in ██████, recent French films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant, centered on a female finding her one true love.
SarahBrown	training	a Wes Craven	There's ████████████ in Chicago feel to it.
SarahBrown	training	John	I can't even narrow it down, although, Sir ████'s character probably gets the most memorable ones.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	"The famous ""I'll alert the media"" when ██████ announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless, but the list is truly endless."
SarahBrown	training	Shani Wallis'	█████████████ Nancy
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike	"2005 Toronto Film Festival Report It is official; ""█████████████"" is whacked."
SarahBrown	training	Colin Geddes	████████████, the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in Japan.
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike	"After the screening I can understand where they were going with that, but damn this is ""█████████████"" after all."
SarahBrown	training	CAPOTE	I'd suggest watching ██████ first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD.
SarahBrown	training	Poirots	Humour was much more prevalent in these early ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark's	███████████ use of special effects was very creative and inventive.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	I always was wondering what █████████ would do if he got his hands on CGI.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Harks's	In most of ████████████ movies he combines drama,fantasy,martial arts and humor.
SarahBrown	training	Josh Hartnett	It's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with █████████████ (also about sexual dysfunction).
SarahBrown	training	Andy	As the title suggests, ████ is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little Pee-Wee Herman in him (the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign).
SarahBrown	training	Jane Lynch	He almost gets with a overly drunk woman, he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl, and almost with his own boss (██████████, also very funny in the mockumentaries) as a (explitive) buddy.
SarahBrown	training	Trish	But this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with █████, who works across the street from him.
SarahBrown	training	Carrell	In fact, if anything, ███████ and the cast build on it to a very high degree.
SarahBrown	training	Rudd	The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, ████'s being the funniest).
SarahBrown	training	Carrell	The big laughs come through because of ███████'s reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth.
SarahBrown	training	Keener	██████ gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like 'Crashers', there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise).
SarahBrown	training	Carrell	For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, ███████ gets very high points here.
SarahBrown	training	Farrelly	And like with a ████████ brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the 'waxing' scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise).
SarahBrown	training	Rita Hayworth	█████████████ is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	██████████ shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph.
SarahBrown	training	Dan	Roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband, ███, had died.
SarahBrown	training	Lilja	I also watched the similar movie █████ 4-ever (as referred to by a previous commentator).
SarahBrown	training	Kalatozov	█████████ is a great director, this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply.
SarahBrown	training	Eric Wiiliams	In 1943, a group of RAF Officers, including █████████████, decide to escape from a POW camp using a Gymnastic Vaulting Horse in the courtyard.
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	I can't think of a better way to escape than to escape with ████████████ who is as sexy as she ever was.
SarahBrown	training	Norma Khouri	and it was fascinating how well ████████████ could pull everybody into her world!
SarahBrown	training	Norma Khouri	The above crime is nothing compared to what ████████████ did to her old neighbor.
SarahBrown	training	Glass	█████ is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind.
SarahBrown	training	Thewlis	The acting was good (apart from ███████)
SarahBrown	training	Morrisey	████████ was also good.
SarahBrown	training	Thewlis	███████ however was lame.
SarahBrown	training	Stone	Overall, this movie not as good the first but █████ is a hoot to watch.
SarahBrown	training	Thewlis	Just ignore ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Lucile Watson	Of course my favorite character was the Grandmother played by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Betty Davis	But I loved the way ███████████ and her family was portrayed.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Now I know many people are mad that he go the █████ and Bogie didn't
SarahBrown	training	Lukas	But █████' performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie I was reduced to tears.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	█████ more than pulls off the role, and fits the plot quite well for what it's asking.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly's	This was ████████████ breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable.
SarahBrown	training	Rusty	But, naturally, that's not what █████ ultimately wants, because, as usual in films of that time, the right guy is the only thing on the girl's mind.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	█████ does the first of his amazing trick dances, this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	The melodrama gets a bit thick, and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two, but █████ takes this film to the next level.
SarahBrown	training	Stephen King	The Shining is a weird example of adaptation: it has very little in common with the source novel, written by ████████████, yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work.
SarahBrown	training	Torrance	Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home of the ████████ family:
SarahBrown	training	Danny	"Because of this ""gift"", the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in █████, even though he is quite capable of resisting them."
SarahBrown	training	Jack	That is not ████'s case, however, as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts, triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	King criticized the director for changing most of the story, omitting most of the Jack/Danny subplot (merely hinted at in the film) that led to the book's emotionally strong climax, and while his disappointment is valid, the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption, albeit in an unconventional way, and redemption is a theme ███████, one of the most famous analysts of human decay, never had a soft spot for.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	What he is interested in is the mental, and subsequently physical, unbalance that threatens the characters, and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot (█████'s encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).
SarahBrown	training	Cuckoo	scene, it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part, and even though the TV version of The Shining from 1997 isn't bad the Torrance character is indelibly linked to the One Flew over the ██████'s Nest star.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	The Shining proves said point to perfection: very little from the novel, approximately 5%, is included in the film, but in ███████ and Nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest, most original horror pictures of all time, which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form.
SarahBrown	training	Keats	I've have already quoted █████ here, but I'll repeat his words: A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
SarahBrown	training	Marc	"When a dark, unknown danger threatens her idyllic ""paperhouse"", the life of ████ is put in jeopardy."
SarahBrown	training	Bernard Rose	Critique: Haunting first debut feature from British director ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Catherine Storr	"Taken from a fable (""Marianne Dreams"") by ███████████████, it leaves plenty of other 'original' fantasy works in its wake."
SarahBrown	training	Rose	Director ████ successfully captures the children fantasy world aspect along with a darkness that seeks to usurp them.
SarahBrown	training	Matt lillard	Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is ████████████, granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks
SarahBrown	training	Lillard	This is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great ███████ film.
SarahBrown	training	vincent D'onofrio	Also very notable in this movie is another great actor named █████████████████, a very under appreciated person in the film industry.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent	███████ and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business.
SarahBrown	training	Matt	This movie kept me very interested besides the fact ████ was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies.
SarahBrown	training	Randolph(Warren Miller	The film has female prisoners planning a daring escape, tired of the crazed antics of their wheel-chair bound warden and her nutty prison doc, ██████████████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Randolph	Belle becomes the obsession of ████████ who promises Superintendent McQueen(Steele)that through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies.
SarahBrown	training	Randolph	Drugging her up, ████████ takes nude pictures and sodomizes her, whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms.
SarahBrown	training	Lavelle	███████ receives work in Randolph's office and is the one responsible for relating his dirty antics to Pandora.
SarahBrown	training	Steele	██████ is superb as the warden, understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far, candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint..notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge.
SarahBrown	training	Demme	Interesting enough, █████ relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension, understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making.
SarahBrown	training	Hydes	For example the way █████ character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	One actor i think who always gets a hard time is ██████████████
SarahBrown	training	Kelso	but i mean he's great in this show i don't think its possible for the the character █████ to have been played by anyone else, it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid.
SarahBrown	training	Mila Kunis	All the main characters are great and it wouldn't be a worth while review if i didn't mention the stone cold fox ██████████, now thats a spicy meet a ball
SarahBrown	training	Richard Dean Anderson	I've been a fan of MacGyver since i was 5 (19 now) and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows of all time star █████████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Pilger	"This documentary explores a story covered in ██████'s latest book ""Freedom Next Time"", which was published in 2006."
SarahBrown	training	Diego Garcia	It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of ████████████, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean.
SarahBrown	training	Diego Garcia	The islanders are technically British citizens, as ████████████ is a British colony, much like Mauritius, the nearby island to where the natives were exiled, used to be.
SarahBrown	training	Pilger	As usual, ██████'s coverage is shocking, especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders.
SarahBrown	training	Pilger	██████ also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the natives.
SarahBrown	training	John Pilger	"It is not easy viewing, but ""Stealing a Nation"" is ███████████ at his best."
SarahBrown	training	Offfice	One person in the local Public Attorney ███████ has a young man prosecuted on false charges.
SarahBrown	training	Dietrich	The irony is that ████████ plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life.
SarahBrown	training	Dietrich	Truly gorgeous cinematography and sets, and yes ████████'s bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous.
SarahBrown	training	Boyer	She look great; █████ looks young and trim.
SarahBrown	training	Max Steiner	Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems pretty stale, but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works, given the two stars, the terrific score by ███████████, and a good supporting cast.
SarahBrown	training	Dietrich	I can't think of any other 30s film ████████ did in color.
SarahBrown	training	Valentino	My favorite is the █████████ as The Shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.
SarahBrown	training	Herzog	I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to ██████ and Kurosawa.
SarahBrown	training	John Kassir	The Crypt Keeper (███████████) tales a tale of holiday FEAR, giving us all Christmas Goose...
SarahBrown	training	YouTube	If you look it up on ███████, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third viewing).
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	The film begins with █████████████ about to begin his performance as a magician.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price's	Had I never seen ███████████████ version of HOUSE OF WAX, I probably would have liked THE MAD MAGICIAN a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9.
SarahBrown	training	Ron Leibman	███████████ was hot and very funny!
SarahBrown	training	Mikhail Kalatozov's	███████████████████ The Cranes are flying is a superb film.
SarahBrown	training	Tatyana Samojlova	Winner of the golden palm at Cannes Film Festival, it has an excellent cinematography and performance by █████████████████, the only Russian actor ever to win an award in Cannes for a performance.
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	She plays ████████, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and without preoccupations, with plans of getting married.
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	The first scene in the stairs is fantastic, but it isn't the only one, there is later a scene when Veronika attempts committing suicide, and another, in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history, the bombing of ████████'s house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire, to find her apartment completely destroyed.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	I guess using ███████'s name was to draw audience attraction (which had back-fired in my case!!!), but then i really can't think of a better title for the film.
SarahBrown	training	Vipul Shaw	"██████████ made his indelible mark with ""Ankhen"", one of the best Comedy Hindi movies."
SarahBrown	training	Malik	In Bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a Bollywood Director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy (mediocre █████ in this instance)is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract.
SarahBrown	training	Akshay Kumar	The duelling and role playing the Father and Son is good acting by Bachachan and ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Sharukh Khan	"Then we have a cheap classless tasteless Producer like ████████████ who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like ""Kaal"" to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of Art, and they surround themselves with borderline talent, and they recoup the investment before the word gets around."
SarahBrown	training	Mandy	I thought this was a splendid showcase for █████'s bodacious bod.
SarahBrown	training	Suzanna Arquette	Consider this a Sports Illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people, especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'Mommy' (████████████████, who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten - she leaves that up to her daughter).
SarahBrown	training	Mandy	(There has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye; █████ certainly is the model for this idealized ratio).
SarahBrown	training	Mandy	█████ might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded German-Guy Victim No. 2, but from all I could see from her bikini shots, she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it.
SarahBrown	training	Mandy	█████'s acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'Mommy's Girl', with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones.
SarahBrown	training	Mandy	If █████ really wants to further her career as an actress, I'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the Romance Languages, especially Italian and Spanish - and maybe French, although I don't know if they would go for her type.
SarahBrown	training	Vambo Drule	███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Granddad	I think the ████████ is funny (Especially when he's watching Great escape) but feel C.J is unnecessary to the show.
SarahBrown	training	Pumba	This semi-sequel to the Lion King sees to spin off side characters Timone and █████, retelling the original story through their eyes, including the story of how they met.
SarahBrown	training	Hakuna Matata	The animation is as good as ever, if a little less flamboyant than the original, but the plot here is all about taking it easy, █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Pumba	On the way he meets █████, another outcast and they become friends.
SarahBrown	training	Simba	Soon they meet █████, a Lion cub, natural predator of T and P, but they form a trio.
SarahBrown	training	Simba	However, when █████ realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group, it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not, and how.
SarahBrown	training	Maria Blom	██████████ controls everything from the beginning, and if you didn't know, you would never guess that this is her first time writing AND directing a feature length film.
SarahBrown	training	Tollinger	█████████'s latest gig comes by as an accident: strolling into town looking for his former fling, he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster.
SarahBrown	training	Sooraj R. Barjatya	In that sense ██████████████████ has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie.
SarahBrown	training	Amrita Rao	Clearly the movie belongs to ██████████ all the way.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid Kapoor	█████████████ performs brilliantly too.
SarahBrown	training	Salman Khan	He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than ███████████ when it comes to acting in a Sooraj R. Barjatya film.
SarahBrown	training	Sooraj R. Barjatya	The movie has top-notch performances, excellent story and great music to suit the film, as well as being directed by the fabulous ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Robert	██████ wrote something that felt close to reality.
SarahBrown	training	Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007	██████████████████████████?
SarahBrown	training	Connery	 Later on after ███████ gets the verdict set aside with evidence he's uncovered, he's feeling pretty good about himself.
SarahBrown	training	Rip Torn	Fine acting on the part of both ████████ and Conchata Ferrell add to an well done script.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	First off, Bend It Like ███████ is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century.
SarahBrown	training	Halle Berry	"Secondly, the acting though not ""███████████ in Monster's Ball"" is still good."
SarahBrown	training	Alice	Here, █████ manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father.
SarahBrown	training	Frank	What she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss, █████.
SarahBrown	training	Emory	Some scenes between █████ and his father are moving.
SarahBrown	training	Emory	█████ hopes his local union will be able to re-open the mill, as they promise to do so.
SarahBrown	training	Emory	There is a triumphant scene at the end where █████ and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Spielberg	████████████████ created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end.
SarahBrown	training	Elliott	███████'s performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic	The viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of ███████ is merely a hallucination, a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Cushing	The following segment features █████████████ as the new occupant of the sinister house.
SarahBrown	training	John	However, ████ appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family.
SarahBrown	training	Pertwee	███████'s character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries.
SarahBrown	training	Johnny	There were some tedious moments - like the informer ██████ and an appearance by some celebrity.
SarahBrown	training	Magoo	And don't count the awful Mr. █████ reworked for live action.
SarahBrown	training	Iris	`Stanley and ████' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life.
SarahBrown	training	Iris	After Stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in Chicago, only to return to ████ and ask her to marry him.
SarahBrown	training	Fräulein Doktor	███████████████ is as good a demonstration as any of how the once great film industry in Western Europe has declined in the past 40 years.
SarahBrown	training	Clint Eastwood	There were the James Bond pictures (Doctor No was a surprise hit in the USA, it was first released at the Century theater chain in NYC with a 99 cent afternoon admission price), the ██████████████ spaghetti westerns (with A Fistful of Dollars released by a distributor that never paid the Italian producers a dime)and French crime movies that usually went to art houses, with exceptions like The Sicilian Clan.
SarahBrown	training	Fräulein Doktor	With its big budget for the time, and the world talent involved, ███████████████ was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth More	████████████, playing a British intelligence officer, has a line in Fräulein Doktor where he tells a caught spy to either talk or he will play the Wall Game.
SarahBrown	training	Belmondo	Fox would no longer co-produce films like The Sicilian Clan, Columbia wouldn't distribute films like ████████'s The Night Caller.
SarahBrown	training	Fräulein Doktor	███████████████ with its lesbian scene was buried, with cut versions of the movie showing up on local stations through the 80s.
SarahBrown	training	Fräulein Doktor	In ███████████████, he had a chance to be a lot tougher than usual, as I recall.
SarahBrown	training	Alberto Lattuada	That was some scene, and ████████████████ showed he was some director, helming this World War I espionage movie, where the money spent on production values really shows up on the screen.
SarahBrown	training	H.G.	The ████ Wells Classic has had several Incarnations.
SarahBrown	training	Walkers	The people of 19th century earth are ill-prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the ███████ and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth.
SarahBrown	training	Timothy Hines	The Film is an excellent accomplishment for director █████████████ who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 Million budget.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh's	"They should make this the official and only true real Hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by █████████████████ ""Hamlet""."
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	It's a perfect, complete version of the play, potent, massive, earthshaking first-class masterpiece ███████████ would have been proud of.
SarahBrown	training	Emilio Miraglia's	"█████████████████ ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences."
SarahBrown	training	Evelyn	Sister ██████ would be the obvious culprit, but she moved to the States recently...
SarahBrown	training	Emilio Miraglia	"███████████████ isn't the most famous giallo-director, as he only made this one and the equally recommended ""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"", but his influence and importance should NOT be forgotten."
SarahBrown	training	Roddenberry	"The Menagerie parts one and two was the only 2-parter during the 3-year run of the original Trek series and it was because ███████████ was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot ""The Cage."""
SarahBrown	training	McCoy	When the jig is up, there's a great scene of Spock surrendering to a flabbergasted █████, as Uhura looks on in shock.
SarahBrown	training	Spock	We really don't know where all this is going and what █████ hopes to accomplish - and that's another thing that makes this a very good 2-parter - we really need to find out what it's all about in the 2nd part.
SarahBrown	training	Kirk	Not only is Spock facing severe penalties, but it looks like ████'s career may be finished, as well.
SarahBrown	training	Kirk	Finally, check out ████'s smug approach at the start of the episode - boy, do things go sideways on him as the story progresses.
SarahBrown	training	Jerry Goldsmith	I remember everything about the original, the steam, the romance, the sex, the interrogation, the music (by the master ███████████████), and everything else from violence and murder, to intense confrontations of all kind!
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	Even if the original director, or writer are not present, all we need is the glamorous, always reliable ████████████, and we have a done deal!
SarahBrown	training	Tremell	Once again, ███████ is the primary suspect of the accident, and will be put under analyst's and psychiatrists.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Glass	Dr. █████████████ (Morrissey) is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her.
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	████████████ dazzles us again, as though 14 years has not come to pass.
SarahBrown	training	David Morrissey	███████████████ is well cast, and manages pretty well.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Mulligan	That is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic coming of age film from Director ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Mulligan	████████ is famous for previously directing Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the coming of age genre.
SarahBrown	training	Reese Witherspoon	█████████████████ is astonishingly good in her film debut, displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt, never striking a false note.
SarahBrown	training	Warfield	████████ and London are both equally good as well.
SarahBrown	training	Jenny Wingfield	Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from ███████████████; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist.
SarahBrown	training	Freddie Francis	The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director ███████████████, who was in his 70's when this was shot.
SarahBrown	training	Gail Strickland	███████████████ is good also as the boy's mother.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Mulligan's	To date, this is █████████████████ last film.
SarahBrown	training	Marlene Dietrich	The cast is excellent and ████████████████ is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and I just loved her in this flick.
SarahBrown	training	Basil Rathbone	██████████████ is also perfect in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Don Bluth	That's what makes this movie so good: the ability, unique in █████████ (director), to play with the people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time.
SarahBrown	training	Don Bluth	█████████, thank you.
SarahBrown	training	Spillane	████████ is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc, but his 'dames' are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence.
SarahBrown	training	Harris	The movie, which is more than a bit sanctimonious, comes alive only in the scenes when ██████ is interrogated by the attorney for another convict.
SarahBrown	training	Harris	Still, worth watching to see ██████ in action.
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Galloway	It tells the story of ████████████████ an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in Ireland to investigate some weird phainomena.
SarahBrown	training	Covenant	Mostly the game revolves around the ████████ estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress.
SarahBrown	training	Clyve Barker	Thanks to the talent of ████████████ the game has an excelent storyline and plot (something very rare for a First person shooter) and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur Bach	███████████ is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multi-millionaire and is attracted to people 'below him' in social standing - he pays for a hooker in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a shoplifter.
SarahBrown	training	John Gielgud	████████████ wipes the floor with everyone else on screen and created a character for the ages.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Talk about deserving an █████.
SarahBrown	training	DeCarlo	Miss ███████'s starring debut has everything the writers could come up with -- from the Franco-Prussian War to the US Civil War, the great American West, San Francisco in its heyday, ballet, opera, vaudeville, stage coach bandits, and a Chinese junk.
SarahBrown	training	Claire Danes	████████████ shines like the star she is in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Michelle Pfeiffer	█████████████████ is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty.
SarahBrown	training	Robert De Niro	██████████████ is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike, ████████ is the way to go.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dance	Although the story is a bit silly, it never quite feels corny, despite the hilarity of the comedy throughout the film; █████████████ off-sets the comedy with his very serious and dark characterisation of the evil that holds the child hostage.
SarahBrown	training	Candyman	I really haven't had this much fun watching a movie since ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Dario Argento	The dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors, but with most dedication towards █████████████ really struck me as cool, these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre.
SarahBrown	training	Arnold	Over the movie has a lot of ██████ rip offs, with one liners you'll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick.
SarahBrown	training	Nick Nolte	██████████ did an excellent job in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	The only other film besides █████████████ that has such an air of hopelessness is On the Beach.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	On the Beach with nuclear war and █████████████ with the environmental poisoning of the planet.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	New York City still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Joseph Cotten	There's been a murder committed, █████████████ an executive with the Soylent Corporation, a multi-national concern that has come up with a food product, some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world's population.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	It's latest product is █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	The investigation finds ███████████████ getting his man, but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of mankind.
SarahBrown	training	Robinson	A few weeks after ████████ wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia, he passed away in real life.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	Though the timetable was off, it doesn't mean that the world envisioned by █████████████ may not come to pass.
SarahBrown	training	Peter	█████'s denial and guilt, however moving, are not as powerfully portrayed as the Judas drama.
SarahBrown	training	Chris Sarandon	██████████████ offers a novel and provocative Christ, whether believable or not.
SarahBrown	training	Diaz	████ has been suspended from duty, but he's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated.
SarahBrown	training	Damian Szifron	Remarkably, even at almost two hours in length Tiempo de Valientes doesn't wear out its welcome, and indeed writer-director ██████████████ sets up a potential sequel in the film's charming coda.
SarahBrown	training	Letyat	"If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war, you need to see ""██████ zhuravli"" (called ""The Cranes are Flying"" in English)."
SarahBrown	training	Boris	█████ is promptly sent off to war.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	█████, meanwhile, continues trotting through the countryside, fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war, until he he runs out of energy.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news, she refuses to accept it, until █████' body arrives home on one of the trains.
SarahBrown	training	Al	The two become good friends, ██ is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team.
SarahBrown	training	Gundam 0080	For only 6 episodes, ███████████ is a well done show.
SarahBrown	training	Gundam	If you liked 0083 then check this one out, or if you are new to the ██████ world, this is a good show to start with.
SarahBrown	training	Macbeth	"An inside look at the staging of ""The Scottish Play"" as actors call ""███████"" when producing it to avoid the curse, this is a crisp, efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe."
SarahBrown	training	Jeremy Sumpter	██████████████ is so hott
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	███████ is half a gangster and half a goodie, which I like.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	███████ is killed by his friend (NOT) and sent to heaven.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	When ███████ comes back to life, it is the start of an amazing adventure.
SarahBrown	training	Anne-Marie	My favourite three are Charlie, Itchy and a little girl called ██████████ who comes slightly later.
SarahBrown	training	Walter Brennan	I know that ██████████████ had died.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Winkelman	only thing I could find out about █████████████████ is he was supposed to be born in 1946.
SarahBrown	training	Glenda	Thank You ██████
SarahBrown	training	SOYLENT	As with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s ███████ GREEN has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is .
SarahBrown	training	Thorn	"█████ gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky , puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line "" If I could afford it I`d smoke two , maybe three of these a day "" ."
SarahBrown	training	Thorn	But it`s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that`s memorable as █████ gazes at the images of wild animals , flowers , running water and snow covered mountains , a world Thorn`s generation has never known .
SarahBrown	training	Miranda Richardson	It says something when ██████████████████ does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast.
SarahBrown	training	Jeremy Sumpter	██████████████ does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of.
SarahBrown	training	Lionel Bart's	It holds up well, especially █████████████ outstanding songs.
SarahBrown	training	Bailey	"In ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ██████ gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born."
SarahBrown	training	Webster	By not getting involved (and by attempting not to care about anyone), ███████ is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt, pushed around, and even killed while he stands by and does nothing.
SarahBrown	training	George Bailey	This reminds the viewer of █████████████ watching a world that has turned upside-down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	"███████, by turning around his philosophy of non-involvement, has, it would seem, earned his ""wings""."
SarahBrown	training	Damon	█████ shines and really has proved a very solid actor, daring you not to believe him in this role.
SarahBrown	training	David Straithrain	A welcome addition to the series in █████████████████ (hope i spelled that close to right) as a seedy CIA agent out to kill Bourne.
SarahBrown	training	Drebin	"Finally, the show takes certain risks that the films avoid; in the first episode, ██████, to ""re-enact the crime"", has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles - ballistics the hard way."
SarahBrown	training	Franco	██████ proves, once again, that he is the prince of surreal & erotic cinema.
SarahBrown	training	Necronomicon	True, much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with Succubus (████████████) he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	What's even more alarming is that █████████ himself wasn't even nominated for Best Director.
SarahBrown	training	Celie	The film spans several years and focuses mainly on █████'s relationships with the women around her.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	As already mentioned, █████████ didn't receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	Such an omission beggars belief, since █████████'s direction here is top-notch.
SarahBrown	training	Quincy Jones's	I'm not especially crazy about ██████████████ score but it's not below average by any means.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as I am about how it could be so poorly treated on █████ night.
SarahBrown	training	Hal Roach	There is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and 'no-worries' overall kind of atmosphere, with a typical █████████ comedy touch to it.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	Appereantly it's a '██████████ story' but I most certainly didn't thought of it that way while watching the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ is a beautiful film, with beautiful songs of course.
SarahBrown	training	Rembrandt	Photographic stills resemble █████████ prints.
SarahBrown	training	Baseketball	My opinion '███████████' is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lots of slapstick violence, yet it actually delivers some laughs and plenty of entertainment.
SarahBrown	training	Keira Knightley's	I think this is one of █████████████████ better films, and I think she's a brilliant actress, and was excellent for the role.
SarahBrown	training	Jonathan Rhys-Meyers	Sadly, I can't say this for ████████████████████, because I don't think that he was that much of a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little scary.
SarahBrown	training	Liam Cunningham's	"Just like in the movie the █████████████████ character says ""the hatred had always been there under the surface""."
SarahBrown	training	Liam Cunningham's	█████████████████ character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man he always wanted to be.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ is one of Disney's greatest films, one of those films I think you appreciate more the older you get.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters Disney ever created.
SarahBrown	training	Capote	I saw this film after watching ██████ and Infamous.
SarahBrown	training	Brooks	The film starts slowly, but on reviewing it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that the writer/director ██████ creates.
SarahBrown	training	Perry	Cutter on the phone is matched-cut to █████ on the phone.
SarahBrown	training	Perry	Cutter washing his face is matched-cut to █████ washing his face.
SarahBrown	training	Perry	Only █████'s looking in the mirror and seeing his eroticized male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in Las Vegas to empty chairs.
SarahBrown	training	Perry	This failure/fantasy matches the failure-fantasy that █████ tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it perpetually empty.
SarahBrown	training	Dick	████ talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don't know that that they're going to die.
SarahBrown	training	Perry	"█████ talks his dream about a yellow bird, ""Taller than Jesus"" who attacks the Nuns who have persecuted them."
SarahBrown	training	Perry	The bird lifted █████ to paradise.
SarahBrown	training	Perry	Strangely, █████ says that he has an aversion to Nuns, God and Religion.
SarahBrown	training	Nancy Cutter	████████████ gets an offer to sleep at a friends house.
SarahBrown	training	Perry	█████ will comment on a picture of her and the house later on.
SarahBrown	training	Bogart	"But it is another ██████ picture, ""Beat the Devil"" which Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is the McGuffin."
SarahBrown	training	Dick	But ████ knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing.
SarahBrown	training	Dick	████ has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them.
SarahBrown	training	Dick	"""There was one witness,"" the detective keeps telling ████ later."
SarahBrown	training	Walt Disney	███████████ really outdid themselves this time.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	 ██████ is a film I watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances, great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it.
SarahBrown	training	Dudley Moore	 ████████████ makes a character that could well be hated very easily (spoiled, rich, lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself) but turns him into someone you love.
SarahBrown	training	John Gielgud	████████████ gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	 I can watch ██████ again and again and it always makes me feel good, check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film.
SarahBrown	training	Tarkovsky	All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union, and reason to conclude that █████████ is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinema.
SarahBrown	training	Chekhov	"I was reading ███████'s ""Three Sisters"" the other day, and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film."
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	"But the first letter of ████████'s name is not a further instance of this; in the Cyrillic alphabet, her name begins with a letter which looks like an English ""B""."
SarahBrown	training	Sandra	"These two talents, both of whom are quite underrated, make ""██████"" a film that should be seen."
SarahBrown	training	Sandra	██████ also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class.
SarahBrown	training	Peck	████'s performance was, as I said, brilliant - to the point, actually, of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film (which is perhaps appropriate, given who he was portraying!)
SarahBrown	training	Ed Flanders	with the possible exception of ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Harry Truman	"I though he offered a compelling look at ████████████ and his attitude to MacArthur: sarcastic (repeatedly referring to MacArthur as ""His Majesty,"") angry, frustrated and finally completely fed up with this General who simply won't respect his authority as President."
SarahBrown	training	Eisenhower	"I have always chuckled at MacArthur's reaction to ██████████ being elected President (""He'll make a fine President - he was the best damn clerk I ever had"" - which seems to sum up what MacArthur thought the role of the President should be, especially to his military commanders during wartime.)"
SarahBrown	training	Robinson	I don't think Mrs. ████████ had anything to do with his success.
SarahBrown	training	Lillian Hellman	Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by ███████████████ who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in August of 1939.
SarahBrown	training	Hellman	So much for the fact that ███████ was merely echoing the Communist party line, the line didn't change until a couple of months later.
SarahBrown	training	Lillian	███████ was actually months ahead of her time with this work.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	█████ took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	█████ is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days.
SarahBrown	training	Davis Lukas	After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, ███████████, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War.
SarahBrown	training	Lucile Watson	They're made welcome by █████████████ who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.
SarahBrown	training	Lukas	Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects █████'s anti-fascist background.
SarahBrown	training	Lukas	█████ fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there.
SarahBrown	training	Dashiell Hammett	████████████████ was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other anti-fascist classic, Casablanca.
SarahBrown	training	Samson	A great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended ██████'s field career.
SarahBrown	training	Clevemore	As █████████ comments, had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department.
SarahBrown	training	Ernesto Gastaldi	████████████████ wrote this fabulous who-dunnit, quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery.
SarahBrown	training	Anita Strindberg	Pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography, the catchy music score, the gorgeous females (████████████████ is a goddess), brutal murders, black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few.
SarahBrown	training	Goerge Hilton	In most parts it's decently acted, █████████████ his usually suave self and others do fairly well.
SarahBrown	training	Martino	███████ directs with a sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	This supernatural ██████████ thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen.
SarahBrown	training	Chris	As he gets closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, █████, and not least about himself.
SarahBrown	training	Chris	█████ tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	A masterful work by ██████████, the master of visually stunning dramas.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Zane's	The film opens as ████████████ character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in.
SarahBrown	training	Iris Iliopulos	After all, it's a MOVIE (see: fiction) & director ██████████████ does what I think is everything possible to 1) Bring Wood's vision to fruition and 2) Give it an updated feel, yet have shots of authentic 50's police cars intertwined with, ahh, local L.A..99$ stores -- so well hence my 9 rating.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	I admit not being that fond of ██████!
SarahBrown	training	Oliver Twist	Rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of ████████████, think of it as a celebration of the classic story.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	The exception is the kid playing ██████, whose job seemed to be to look cute and stay out of the real performers' way.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	█████ and the Dodger are the real stars of this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony McGarten	████████████████ has adapted his play, Via Satellite, and directed the best comedic film to come out of New Zealand for a long time.
SarahBrown	training	Mona	One is like an adult ████-my-biological-clock-is-ticking-away, the other a narcisstic tramp who has what her sister desires - a bun in the oven.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Perrault	It's not clear where the story takes place, but I suppose it's somewhere in France because this is based in a tale by ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Jaques	██████ is very smart and amusing.
SarahBrown	training	Gus	███ might not be that smart, but he's humorous.
SarahBrown	training	Prince Philip	"No doubt that █████████████ from ""Sleeping Beauty"" was inspired on this prince, because they are very similar-looking."
SarahBrown	training	Lady Tremaine	On the other hand, █████████████ (the stepmother) isn't supposed to be likable because she's cold, jealous, bitter and cruel.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████, the main character, has nothing to do with them.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ is gentle, kind, pretty and lovable.
SarahBrown	training	Lucifer	███████ (the cat) is hilariously malicious.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	He always agrees with the stepmother's attitudes towards ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lucifer	███████ has the right name for him because he's such a devilish and mean cat.
SarahBrown	training	Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo	"The best song in this movie is ""███████████████████""."
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	Meanwhile, ██████, played by the also very gorgeous and talented Busy Phillips, is a nasty, cold-hearted, rebellious, anti-social goth girl who doesn't have a single positive trait on her... and she is unharmed when the shooting happens.. because it turns out, she was FRIENDS with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did... which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions..
SarahBrown	training	Deana	the principal decides enough is enough, and forces her to go visit █████ in the hospital..
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	Of course she refuses this too, but the principal says that if ██████ doesn't do this, the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something.. and so she actually goes to see her...
SarahBrown	training	Mr K's	This film is as much about war and love as it is about the Soviet thaw of ██████ era.
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	This motion picture has a steady, haunting pace backed up with great acting (one of ███████████'s best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time.
SarahBrown	training	Weir	████'s story is enhanced by using aboriginals, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous.
SarahBrown	training	Ursula Le Guin's	"Although they are unrelated in story as well as genre, this maintained the same feeling within me as ████████████████ ""Lathe of Heaven"" (1980)."
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	First, I was a typical high school senior, in a ███████████ class I didn't really even like, much less understood half of!
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	███████████ would be no more than UNINTELLIGIBLE without me pouring ALL my concentration into his almost encrypted plays... encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language....
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Now, the script was followed to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in ███████████ class.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	But lo and behold... when performed, and only then, ███████████ comes to life.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	So this version of Hamlet showed me that ███████████ is indeed a master, who wrote great stories.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	It allows for more raw emotion... when words can't describe something, maybe ███████████'s words can.
SarahBrown	training	shakespeare	Even more amazing, it made me appreciate ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	By the way, all you kids out there in a ███████████ class... forget it.
SarahBrown	training	Crystin Sinclaire	█████████████████) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside.
SarahBrown	training	John Cales'	"Bouncing along to ███████████ flavorful score, ""Caged Heat"" is upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time."
SarahBrown	training	Lena	████ is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren't we all?
SarahBrown	training	Altman	"Some of the acknowledged ██████ ""masterpieces"" seem sadder to me now."
SarahBrown	training	Altman	"Like the last reviewer, I even like this ""lesser"" ██████ (shown recently on FMC), although I don't think he was aiming at a wide audience."
SarahBrown	training	Dick Cavett	"Some of this satirical ""docudrama"" is now dated, like ███████████ watching the Tonight Show, but I found much of the dialog funny and insightful (e.g. ""You are for real."
SarahBrown	training	Altman	All in the inimitable ██████ style, although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual.
SarahBrown	training	Dedee Pfeiffer	I loved ██████████████ (is that spelled right?) in Cybil.
SarahBrown	training	Nicole Kidman	In some angles, the daughter even looked like a young █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	Personally I never liked ███████ as Bond because he fit the icon too closely.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	Its great to see ███████ play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall.
SarahBrown	training	Greg Kinear	It's an impressive portrayal, and having ███████████ to ground him, is just poetic.
SarahBrown	training	Tessa	The couch scene for █████ was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition.
SarahBrown	training	Calamity Jane	█████████████ is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home.
SarahBrown	training	Jessica Alba	The action is great but ████████████ is the best and most gorgeous star on TV today.
SarahBrown	training	Sergio Martino	Rock solid giallo from a master filmmaker of the genre, ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ernesto Gestaldi	Fashioned from a marvelous screenplay by ████████████████, this shocking mystery often develops fascinating twists until the terrific finale which most might not see coming throughout the film.
SarahBrown	training	Lara(Janine Reynaud	The wife is Lisa(Ida Galli)and the mistress demanding half the money is ███████████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Lisa	She tells ████ she knows that the death was arranged by her to get the insurance money.
SarahBrown	training	Lara	"████ says she'll use her ""lawyer"", Sharif(Luis Barboo)to get that money."
SarahBrown	training	Lisa	So already, the film produces two possible suspects in the later murder of ████, who awaiting someone in Tokyo.
SarahBrown	training	Peter	█████ works for a company that investigates those who gain inheritance to see if the pay day was gathered under suspicious means.
SarahBrown	training	Lisa	When, on his watch, ████ is killed by a man dressed from head to toe in black in her hotel room, he is a possible suspect.
SarahBrown	training	Felleghy)on	He decides to do a little investigating himself, while also assisting Inspector Stavros(Luigi Pistilli)and Interpol agent, Benton(Tom ███████████ their quest to find a killer.
SarahBrown	training	Lisa	The killer strikes several times eliminating anyone revolving around the missing million dollars confiscated by the one responsible for the murder of ████.
SarahBrown	training	Kline	I don't anyone better than █████ at playing THICKheaded.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	█████ exclamation.
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	" I think this is the only movie where I didn't find myself impatient with ███████████████ characterization; I thought she was ""spot on"" in every note she struck."
SarahBrown	training	Jewison	Most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect, but director ███████ hit a home run every time.
SarahBrown	training	Dick Hyman's	The cast got just the right take on the excellent script, and in addition, ████████████ musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match.
SarahBrown	training	oscar	Laughs, adventure, a good time, a killer soundtrack, █████-worthy acting, and special effects/ animitronics like none other, what else could you want in a movie?
SarahBrown	training	David Zucker	Although it is directed by ████████████ and is utterly rediculous, it has a sincere message about corporate America and the disgrace that is major league sports.
SarahBrown	training	Floraine(Adele Haenel	Marie(Pauline Acquart) is a water lily, a synchronized swimming groupie with a crush on █████████████████████), a frog, the captain of her team.
SarahBrown	training	Floraine	████████'s teammates shun their leader because the preternaturally curvy and well-proportioned blonde conveys a loose persona that betrays the syncrhronized swimmer's mindset of conformity and discipline.
SarahBrown	training	Floraine	████████ has never gone, as they say, all the way, with a boy.
SarahBrown	training	Floraine	████████ wants boys to like her, but she doesn't like boys, seemingly, but it's more important to the frog that she's popular.
SarahBrown	training	Floraine	████████'s beauty is a burden.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	"Later, in the final shot, ""Naissance des pieuvres"" suggests that █████ has a double, too, and this symbiosis among water lilies has the potential to turn parasitic in the near-future, if it not already has."
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	██████ remains street tough, and elusive.
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	██████ cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way.
SarahBrown	training	Yvonne	██████ is such a talented woman and beautiful.
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey	"""Party Girl"" capitalizes on the tremendous charm of ████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Posey	In fact, at times, the movie seems to be a vehicle in which Ms. █████ is allow to play herself, as she normally is in real life.
SarahBrown	training	Von Scherler Mayer	Ms. ██████████████████ takes us on a wild trip into lower Manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents.
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey	████████████ makes an amazing Mary.
SarahBrown	training	John Williams	My surprise was great when I discovered the score to have been written by none other than █████████████ himself.
SarahBrown	training	Williams	But in my opinion what ████████ has written for this movie surpasses anything I've ever heard of his for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	"█████████████ stars in this remarkable comedy ""Show People"" released by MGM in 1928."
SarahBrown	training	Davies	The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is ██████ outrageous southern costume.
SarahBrown	training	William Haines	She meets fellow slapstick star ██████████████, who is immediately smitten with her.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	"Well, ██████ then gets a job at a more prestigious studio (""High Art Studios"") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces."
SarahBrown	training	Andre Telefair	A handsome but fake actor (██████████████) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	"█████████████ is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a ""serious"" actress."
SarahBrown	training	Mardi Gras	The film ██████████: Made in China was a good way of showing the world how something as petty as beads for a celebration can effect the lives of so many people in another country.
SarahBrown	training	Helen Hunt	██████████ continues to amaze me with her ability to take on tough roles adapting her core persona to fit each role.
SarahBrown	training	Kei	███ is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others, the half-life of a vampire.
SarahBrown	training	Warners	"Even though we have a setting of the upper classes on Long Island there is the generic ███████ style embedded here with a narrative that could have been ""torn from the headlines""."
SarahBrown	training	Warners	"Another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that ""They're not the trophies"" gives the film a more working mans, down to earth feel, for these were the audiences that ███████ were targeting in the great depression."
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	Bend it Like ███████ is much more than a cheesy sports flick.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Shadyac	The supremely-talented ███████████ was involved in the project.
SarahBrown	training	Tom	Again, this is the kind of perfectionism that we've come to expect from ███.
SarahBrown	training	John	████ unfortunately passed away in 2003 leaving a fond memory and near-sure cancellation contemplations by the suits.
SarahBrown	training	Al Bundy	████████ was our hero.
SarahBrown	training	Katey	█████ was a MILF back then and still is: a brune now (instead of a redhead) and just as buxom as ever.
SarahBrown	training	Cate	████ is the conservative mom and loving wife.
SarahBrown	training	Kaley Cuoco	 The Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played to perfection by ███████████): almost never has an idiot been played so well.
SarahBrown	training	Bridget	Aside of Gob on Arrested Development, ███████ may well be a shoe-in for any awards given to this archetype.
SarahBrown	training	Bridget	███████ is shallow, self-centered, not very bright and a tad slutty in his look.
SarahBrown	training	Bridget	She's ███████'s younger sister (in reality she's older than her) and the two's extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes, to much of our amusement.
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter	 Those characters were the main ones at the time of ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Larry Miller	Unfortunately enough, the insanely hilarious ████████████ (one of my favorites) did not get lots of screen time.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	He played ████'s co-worker/competitor.
SarahBrown	training	Ritter	After an aortic dissection cost ██████ his life in 2003 (September 11th), the show was on hiatus for a while.
SarahBrown	training	Ritter	It was done slowly, carefully and excellently, with constant respect paid to the Paul (██████).
SarahBrown	training	Spade	I knew █████ was funny, I just didn't know he was THIS funny.
SarahBrown	training	David Spade's	This eerie feeling is kinda like seeing someone borrow lots of material from █████████████ appearances in movies, talk shows and functions (award shows, etc.) and delivering a superb impersonation of Spade's voice and comedy style, except, that it IS Spade.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Brosnan	"""The Matador"" stars ██████████████ as a burned out assassin."
SarahBrown	training	James Bond	He's ██████████ gone to seed, in too-tight, garish clothes, gold chains, and an ugly haircut.
SarahBrown	training	Julian Noble	Our struggling assassin, ████████████, is in Mexico, trying to regain his nerve.
SarahBrown	training	Wright	Noble and ██████ unexpectedly become friends.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Shepard	 Writer and director ███████████████ did the Q&A after this delightful movie at the Austin Film Festival.
SarahBrown	training	Shepard	███████ was also down on his luck.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Brosnan	Then ██████████████ called.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	███████ regains his equilibrium in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Shepard's	I look forward to more of █████████████████ projects.
SarahBrown	training	Brando	And ██████ should have won for best actor.
SarahBrown	training	David Zucker	How can it not be given that this movie stars the creators of South Park and is directed by ████████████?
SarahBrown	training	Andy	The main character ████ is (unfortunately for me) a person I can relate to.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	████ also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	████ doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	Most importantly of all; ████ is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	The other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way ████ does.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell	An interesting little note about that scene; the actor ████████████ actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell	Actually since we're talking about ████████████, I'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since I didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	When I watched █████████, I was amazed at how great the story line actually was.
SarahBrown	training	Alain	Could there be anyone as beautiful as █████ going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat?
SarahBrown	training	Jude Law	No one nowadays can touch him--though someone like ████████ could try I guess.
SarahBrown	training	Ian Holm	I even considered writing to ████████ to see if he might have a copy!
SarahBrown	training	Deighton	Like others, I purchased and read the ████████ series (in part to understand the complicated plot.)
SarahBrown	training	Bette	"From her opening number, her classic ""Friends"", where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud, █████ commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called ""I Look Good"" she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections."
SarahBrown	training	Sophie Tucker	but she does manage to incorporate her old █████████████ jokes here to good advantage (even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it, but her ad-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical).
SarahBrown	training	Bette	"█████ also treats us to ""Rose's Turn"" from GYPSY and the title tune from her smash film THE ROSE as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB."
SarahBrown	training	Midler	It's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for ██████ fans, it's a must.
SarahBrown	training	Moon Child	██████████ was one of the more symbolic movies I've seen.
SarahBrown	training	Kei	The movie depicts a great deal of vampire ███ having the power of immorality and the advantages to it.
SarahBrown	training	Toshi	The scene where character █████ dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the acting were put into it.
SarahBrown	training	Moon	Nevertheless, I think ████ Child should be a movie everyone should consider watching.
SarahBrown	training	Gordon	Sadly, ██████, only in his early forties, died soon after completing this, his only feature film.
SarahBrown	training	Linda Marolla	Of course, he doesn't love her and by chance, runs into █████████████, a working-class waitress (and of course, aspiring actress) after she pilfers a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father.
SarahBrown	training	Moore	The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by █████.
SarahBrown	training	Hobson	It's the type of role he could play in his sleep, but Gielgud makes ██████ such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings.
SarahBrown	training	Geraldine Fitzgerald	The one fly in the ointment is veteran actress ████████████████████, who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	And I have to admit that I still can't stand the very dated, overplayed Christopher Cross song that inevitably won the █████ for that year's best song.
SarahBrown	training	Tim Matheson	Im not a big ████████████ fan
SarahBrown	training	taxman	the summary from ██████ is great.
SarahBrown	training	John Woo	The reason I wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in ████████ style!
SarahBrown	training	John Woo	There is only one ████████ and til this day there hasn't been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action!
SarahBrown	training	Ron Liebman	███████████ might hate it, but he is nearly perfect, and unforgettable.
SarahBrown	training	Pinto	Too bad my █████'s brief appearance, usually seems to get cut for TV.
SarahBrown	training	Farrelly	OK, I would not normally watch a ████████ brothers movie.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Fallon	I also don't recall watching a ████████████ movie.
SarahBrown	training	Drew Barrymore	But, this movie had ██████████████ and I just think she is the cutest thing.
SarahBrown	training	Adam Sandler	I mean I even watched ████████████ just to see her in 50 First Dates.
SarahBrown	training	Cartwright	It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any ██████████ men.
SarahBrown	training	Ben Cartwright	After all ██████████████ was three times a widower with a son by each marriage.
SarahBrown	training	Ben Cartwright	But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch ██████████████ and his stalwart sons.
SarahBrown	training	Ben Cartwright	██████████████ was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name.
SarahBrown	training	Kennedys	I daresay more people cared about this family than the ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Pernell Roberts	 ███████████████ as oldest son Adam was written out of the show.
SarahBrown	training	Cartwright	Rumor has it he didn't care for the noble ██████████ characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Landon	This was just the beginning for ██████████████, how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit.
SarahBrown	training	Landon	██████ also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control.
SarahBrown	training	Joe	Little ███ was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights.
SarahBrown	training	Roberts	 When ███████ left.
SarahBrown	training	Dan Blocker	the show kept going with the two younger sons, but when big ███████████ left, the heart went out of Bonanza.
SarahBrown	training	Hoss	But big, loyal, but a little thick ████ was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights.
SarahBrown	training	Cartwright	But near Lake Tahoe, just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits, is the ██████████ home, the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction.
SarahBrown	training	Sherlock Holmes	Like 21 Baker Street for ███████████████ fans, the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real.
SarahBrown	training	Romero	The south park creators have done the best spoof of a ██████ film I have ever seen.
SarahBrown	training	Romero	They have truly touched on ██████'s underlying social commentary that he has made with each one of his films.
SarahBrown	training	George Romero's	I would love to know what ███████████████ opinion was on this episode I'm sure it was purely positive!
SarahBrown	training	Millie	I laugh every time at ██████, the maid pretending to be a débutante, holding her dainty hankie while chatting, and mindlessly polishing furniture with it as she chats.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Sinatra	My mom saw █████████████ at a theater about the same time this movie came out.
SarahBrown	training	Frank	This movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young █████ was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well.
SarahBrown	training	Victor Borge	And ████████████ gets in a bit of his routine in, which is a bonus.
SarahBrown	training	Goldberg	Whoopie ████████ should have one an award for amazing portrayal.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when ████ and his peers are no longer the elite.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and ████'s generation is suddenly obsolete.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	He has few lines in this movie, but ███████ speaks volumes with his eyes.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of ████ is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	And he's given ████ a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype.
SarahBrown	training	Anderson	████████ has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction.
SarahBrown	training	Drake	I had forgotten Santa was played by █████ over the years.
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey	It's pretty dated, almost passe, but ████████████ is so brilliant that it's unbelievable.
SarahBrown	training	Parker	If you want to be charmed by a 90's Breakfast at Tiffany's, attended 90's raves, or love ██████, this movie is for you.
SarahBrown	training	Tim Burton	This is indeed a funny show, done in a creepy sort of way, much like a ██████████ film.
SarahBrown	training	Earl	"I think it's the funniest thing on the tube since ""My Name is ████""."
SarahBrown	training	Twin Peaks	It's not as strange as ██████████ was, but it's got a serious kink to it.
SarahBrown	training	Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge	The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is █████████████████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Beeb	I saw the original on TV sometime ago and remembered this production as less gripping than most ████ costume drama.
SarahBrown	training	Gilbert	Steadfast hero ███████ was certainly a saint to put up with his ladylove's variable and often cryptic behaviour and persistent self-denial and to be so consistently supportive.
SarahBrown	training	Helen	So I felt it a great shame that when █████ was at long last free to be with him, the script didn't allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up.
SarahBrown	training	Tara Fitzgerald	███████████████ was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather sanctimonious victim so much of the time.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings Builds	Mr. ████████████████ His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed.
SarahBrown	training	Jim Blandings	Ad man █████████████, along with his wife and two daughters, are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment, as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	Nothing comes easy in this life, as Mr. █████████ learns; but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	But, █████████ asks himself every few minutes, how long is long?
SarahBrown	training	W.C.	There is real warmth in the picture, and a good deal of (████)
SarahBrown	training	Georges	Everybody can learn from ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Pasolini	Now I can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the Italian cinema (████████ etc.), by that time gone.
SarahBrown	training	David	While defending the Aborigines, █████ learns the last wave theory, and begins to wonder whether it's just mythology.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	██████████ created a perplexing, but thought-provoking, movie.
SarahBrown	training	David Gulpilil	"Aboriginal actor ██████████████ (whom you may have seen in ""Walkabout"", ""Crocodile Dundee"" and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"") provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants."
SarahBrown	training	Alba	"With Max(Jessica ████) as an escaped X-5, manticore creation, trying to adapt to a normal life, but still ""saving the world""."
SarahBrown	training	James Cameron	And with █████████████ behind this it can't go wrong.
SarahBrown	training	Joseph Campbell	███████████████, I believe, would have liked this film.
SarahBrown	training	ANNE Bronte	"That said, finally, it is ███████████ who has, in her single assay?, proved the ""feminist"" point, way way ahead of contemporary types, and including the ""voting franchise"" ranks."
SarahBrown	training	Stewart Granger	Here ███████████████ is the good guy, a world weary buffalo hunter, who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial considerations.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Taylor	The partner he's chosen to throw in with is █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Louis Calhern	In Devil's Doorway he was an American Indian fighting against the prejudice stirred up by a racist played by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Debra Paget's	Like some barbarian conqueror he expects the pleasure of █████████████ sexual favors.
SarahBrown	training	Paget	He's actually mad when █████ doesn't see it that way.
SarahBrown	training	Russ Tamblyn	No matter how often they refer to ████████████ as a halfbreed, I was never really convinced he was any part Indian.
SarahBrown	training	Nolan	█████ steals every scene he's in with the cast.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Taylor	 For those who like their westerns real, who want to see a side of █████████████ never seen on screen, and who don't like cheap heroics, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
SarahBrown	training	Ricardo	███████ and his wife Poli, with their true-to-life plot and their award winning direction(**), were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, living a nightmare that doesn't seem to end !!!
SarahBrown	training	Leon Errol	He's the butler and she's the scullery maid to ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Errol	In fact █████ is a millionaire who hasn't paid his help for seven months.
SarahBrown	training	Errol	█████'s a delightful old soul to work for and none of the staff want to lose a good thing.
SarahBrown	training	Michele	Only ███████ starts looking at another.
SarahBrown	training	Sinatra	███████ sang three good ballads all of them had some kind of commercial success, The Music Stopped, A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening, and I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Sinatra	To get their material out, █████████████ recorded the songs from Higher and Higher with an acapella chorus for Columbia.
SarahBrown	training	Bing Crosby	███████████ recorded songs from his film Dixie in the same manner for Decca.
SarahBrown	training	James C. Petrillo	Both of them were denounced by the president of the union, █████████████████ as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again.
SarahBrown	training	Sinatra	The strike provided some anxious moments for ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Dorsey	It closed off a needed venue for his artistry when he wasn't sure whether leaving ██████ would prove to be a right career move.
SarahBrown	training	Pearl Buck	From the upper shelf of great Classic Books, comes this masterful story written by ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Charley Grapewin	Wang has his 'Old Father' (████████████████) to advise and remind him of life's fragile and fickle nature.
SarahBrown	training	Clapton	███████'s solos have a formation that he sometimes doesn't have when on stage with his solo band.
SarahBrown	training	Ginger Baker	████████████, enough said.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Powell	"██████████████ wrote, directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real ""tour-de-force""."
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	Their father is Reverend ███████ and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion, and the lessons of fly-fishing.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	██████ goes to Dartmouth to study.
SarahBrown	training	Jess	This dilemma is introduced by a young British-born teen girl - Jasminder (████) - of east-Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer.
SarahBrown	training	Jess	 The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore ████'s frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships.
SarahBrown	training	Sooraj R. BarjatyaGot	█████████████████████ it right this time,
SarahBrown	training	Ke Hai Kaun	okay I was not a huge fan of Hum App ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Poonam	When Prem meets ██████ for the first time, they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way Prem and Poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen.
SarahBrown	training	Poonam	What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and ██████, how they fall for each other is too sweet.
SarahBrown	training	Ishq Vishk	If ██████████ didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will.
SarahBrown	training	Prem	Scenes which touched me was when ████ takes Poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet.
SarahBrown	training	Slavoj Zizek	"So begins ""The Pervert's Guide to Cinema,"" in which Slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst ████████████ applies his Freudian/Lacanian brain-scalpel to world cinema."
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	Over the course of the film, █████ guides us through a catalog of obsession and desire in film history.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	"Thematically, █████'s inquiry into cinema ranges from thoughts on the death drive to the ""coordinates of desire,"" and from Gnosticism to ""partial objects."""
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	The film frequently cuts from movie clips to images of █████ *inside* the movie he is talking about--that is, in the original locations and sets.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	"And █████ himself is constantly making us laugh, either from bizarre little jokes or from his enthusiastic insistence on, for example, a bold Oedipal interpretation of ""The Birds."""
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	It is the spoonful of sugar that helps us digest █████'s weird medicine.
SarahBrown	training	John	When ████ was still around I really didn't laugh as much as I do now.
SarahBrown	training	Rory	My favorite character must be ████.
SarahBrown	training	Rory	poor ████ is almost always left out.
SarahBrown	training	Joan Crawford's	This is one of ███████████████ best Talkies.
SarahBrown	training	Joan Crawford	 █████████████ is excellent as the socialite-turned-moll.
SarahBrown	training	Clark Gable	███████████ is a diamond-in-the rough, masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with Crawford's character.
SarahBrown	training	Norma Shearer	"The same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite █████████████ in ""A Free Soul"", securing his position as top male sex symbol at MGM."
SarahBrown	training	Crawford	"If you like ████████ in this type of role, don't miss ""Paid"", which she did a year earlier, which is also among her best early Talkie performances."
SarahBrown	training	Park Chan-Wook's	And hopefully you are already familiar with ████████████████ work.
SarahBrown	training	Oldboy	"The vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with, how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of ""Sympathy For Mr Vengeance"" with the frantic and extravagance of ""██████""?"
SarahBrown	training	Park Chan-Wook	██████████████ has incredible style, but his movies don't all share the SAME style!
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	"The man who directed 'The Third Man' also directed the 'Who Will Buy' sequence in ""██████!"""
SarahBrown	training	Carol Reed	I raise my hat to ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	(It does show in the final scene with Nancy [ avoiding spoiler - everyone has to see ██████!
SarahBrown	training	Casper	I remember ██████ comic books, but don't remember any cartoons.
SarahBrown	training	Ferdie	"""██████"" the fox becomes a spirit-figure like Casper, jumps on his lap, licks his face and the narrator comments ""they lived happily ever after."""
SarahBrown	training	Sam Waterstone	██████████████ was my favorite actor these days (i think i was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day, mostly due to his appearance in the series.
SarahBrown	training	Brad Pitt	I can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like ████████ did all throughout the course of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	As magically fairy-tale-like as The Princess Bride, ████████ is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Elliot	A real family film and the best British comedy film I've seen since ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Annette	Me and my girlfriend, ███████, watched this together and we'll both comment.
SarahBrown	training	Dicken	Both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with ██████'s work.
SarahBrown	training	TRAVIS	██████:
SarahBrown	training	Travis	That's really saying a lot coming from ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver Reed	Man, that ███████████ can really do a good villain.
SarahBrown	training	the Oliver Twist	I hated ████████████████ kid tho.
SarahBrown	training	Bill Sikes	(I kept wishing ██████████ would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene.)
SarahBrown	training	Secombe	"I saw Mr. ███████ perform in another movie entitled ""Davy"" where he played an opera singer with pleasing results."
SarahBrown	training	Harry Secombe	The talented █████████████ should have been in a lot more movies.
SarahBrown	training	TRAVIS	██████: As I mentioned earlier the story isn't quite true to the book, but IMO it was more robust.
SarahBrown	training	Travis	Any musical movie which ██████ watches completely has to be a rare find.
SarahBrown	training	TRAVIS	██████:
SarahBrown	training	Masterson	█████████ is not necessarily a good director.
SarahBrown	training	Toyomichi Kurita	The slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer ████████████████, who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light & warmth.
SarahBrown	training	Lukas Haas	"██████████, a young actor who I was familiar with from ""Testament"" and ""Witness"", plays a character very much like his other early roles."
SarahBrown	training	Kate	The scene at the garden with ████ was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist').
SarahBrown	training	gore	The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of ████.
SarahBrown	training	Homere	A second reason is that the poetry expressed by ██████ in his poem is well given by the production.
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Nicolai	Fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful █████████████ score.
SarahBrown	training	Morricone	He may not be █████████ but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Stewart	█████████████ is a special favorite of mine.
SarahBrown	training	David Morse	███████████ again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop.
SarahBrown	training	Nicholas	I thought the Darkheart character much more evil then the ████████ of the first.
SarahBrown	training	Jess	You just can't help but to root for ████ in this film!
SarahBrown	training	Batman	This was a well written tale of the Making of the ██████ Sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their TV shows history.
SarahBrown	training	IKWYDLS	 Another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl, unlike in SCREAM and ███████ where it was obvious.
SarahBrown	training	Judd Nelson	and all the time we are routing for ███████████ to get away with it, we as the viewers are on his side.
SarahBrown	training	Judd	████ is one of the scariest villains ever, and he's more realistic, he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors.
SarahBrown	training	Ilkka Järvi-Laturi	Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen, although it is made by a Finnish director ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Tallin Pimeduses	████████████████ is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia.
SarahBrown	training	Unfortenately Järvi-Laturi's	████████████████████████████ other films are far from this kind of achievements.
SarahBrown	training	Jaco Van Dormal's	"Though the plot elements to ""The Eighth Day"" seem like they have been done plenty of times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that █████████████████ first film had."
SarahBrown	training	Daniel Auteil	"█████████████, from 2001's flavorless ""The Closet"" downplays his part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic)."
SarahBrown	training	Stephenie Meyer's	I think men are prone to hate █████████████████ work (and its offspring) to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated.
SarahBrown	training	Chan-Wook	█████████ doesn't embellish the story enough to elevate this to must-see.
SarahBrown	training	Sabu	████'s genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Sabu	Another example of ████'s genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired.
SarahBrown	training	Sabu	So here is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which ████ manages to show throughout the film.
SarahBrown	training	Sabu	"""Monday"" and ""Postman Blues"" that do justice to ████'s claim that he is a genius."
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	Mr. █████████, a New York ad executive, decides to move his family to the Connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	I thought that the funniest scenes were where █████████ hires a contractor to dig a well for water.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	Mrs. █████████ is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing, and there's a black maid (horrors!).
SarahBrown	training	Adolph Hitler	If you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a RAF Lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of May 1945 is somewhat unlikely since German air defences were as lively as █████████████ on that day but this isn't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience
SarahBrown	training	Richar Attenborough's	When █████████████████████ young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didn't survive the war .
SarahBrown	training	Peter Carter	it's obvious Nazis don't go to heaven  The plot itself where dashing young pilot ████████████ arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext , you see A MATTER OR LIFE AND DEATH is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the British empire as it's replaced by American ambitions .
SarahBrown	training	Powell	██████ and Pressburger know their history when it comes to Britain and America .
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte Burke	I especially thought ███████████████ was really excellent here.
SarahBrown	training	Marc	Her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across, especially at the end when she realised that although ████ had died, she knew he was going to be alright.
SarahBrown	training	Anna	Several scenes did make me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the bathtub, the scene where ████'s father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust.
SarahBrown	training	Edmund Burke	"████████████ said that ""all evil needs is for good me to do nothing."""
SarahBrown	training	Neil Simon's	in one of ████████████ best plays.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Robinson's	This was ████████████████ 101st film and his last, and he died of cancer nine days after shooting was complete.
SarahBrown	training	Heston	██████ said he had wanted to make the film for some time because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation.
SarahBrown	training	Marlene Gorris	██████████████ has established herself as one of the world's great directors.
SarahBrown	training	Vladimir Nabokov	This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by ████████████████ and captures well that writer's dark irony.
SarahBrown	training	Constantine	A little bit of Babe, Casino and ███████████, all this well mixed into a carton, and we get this.
SarahBrown	training	spescially	I hate when a film (██████████ a carton)can have a good end and its ruining because every character must have a happy end, even if it sounds weird (Im not a bitter person).But this was OK, he simply goes heaven
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Muller	An anti-Fascist, a worker in the underground movement, many times injured, and wanted by the Nazis, ███████████ (Lukas) is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law.
SarahBrown	training	Lillian Hellman's	Great performances abound in this film, written very much to put forth █████████████████ liberal point of view.
SarahBrown	training	Lillian Hellman	"███████████████ is not everyone's cup of tea, but unlike ""The Little Foxes,"" she has written some truly sympathetic, wonderful characters and a fine story given A casting and production values by Warner Brothers."
SarahBrown	training	Babe	The TV production isn't perfect but it presents the ████'s story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional telling.
SarahBrown	training	Ruth	"This film makes a great companion piece to ""Eight Men Out"" since the story starts with ████'s arrival in New York in 1920, one year after the Black Sox Scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin."
SarahBrown	training	Jim Blandings	█████████████, a Madison Ave. executive, has had it!
SarahBrown	training	Jim	Obviously, a first time owner, ███ is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent.
SarahBrown	training	Jim	As one problem leads to another, more money is necessary, and whatever was going to be the original cost, ends up in an inflated price that ███ could not really afford.
SarahBrown	training	James Wong Howe	The film is lovingly photographed by ███████████████, who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better.
SarahBrown	training	H.C. Potter	The direction of ███████████ is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies.
SarahBrown	training	Hain Kon	This movie is also from the makers of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Rabin	One of the best records of Israel's response to the murder of █████.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh	███████████████ was attempting something much more ambitious- a film based on the complete text of the play, with a running time of around four hours.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	(The flowers in the description of Ophelia's death suggest that ███████████ himself thought of the action happening in summer).
SarahBrown	training	Zeffirelli	(There is a contrast here with ██████████'s film, where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone).
SarahBrown	training	Brian Blessed	█████████████, who often plays jovial characters, is cast against type as the Ghost, and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frightening.
SarahBrown	training	Kate Winslet's	Of the major characters, perhaps the weakest was ██████████████ Ophelia.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Briers	██████████████ plays Polonius with a greater dignity than he is often given, a wise and experienced counsellor rather than a prating old fool.
SarahBrown	training	Gibson	The age difference between Christie and Branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son, which was certainly not the case with Close and ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Zeffirelli	a subplot ignored altogether by ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Claudius	This emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of ████████, sometimes played as a one-dimensional villain.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Branagh, a wonderfully fluent speaker of ███████████'s verse, is superb in the main role.
SarahBrown	training	Gibson	Like ██████, he has little time for the old concept of Hamlet as indecisive, passive and melancholy.
SarahBrown	training	James Berardinelli	It was, however, praised by many critics, ██████████████████ being particularly enthusiastic.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	By concentrating on the full text, he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of ███████████'s most complex play.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	"When I reviewed his ""Much Ado"", I said it was the greatest ever film of a ███████████ comedy."
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	"His ""Hamlet"" may just be the greatest ever film of a ███████████ tragedy."
SarahBrown	training	Marcus Aurelius	"███████████████  The DVD release of ""Watch on the Rhine"" could not come at a better moment."
SarahBrown	training	Bette Davis	It presents a subtle performance by ███████████, who took a subdued secondary role long after she'd become the workhorse queen at the Warner Bros. lot.
SarahBrown	training	Cary Grant	"We've heard ██████████ sermonizing in ""Destination Tokyo"" (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives."
SarahBrown	training	Franklin Roosevelt	I have an 81-year-old friend who curses ██████████████████ regularly.
SarahBrown	training	FDR	He feels that ███ connived the U.S. into a foreign fight we didn't need, and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin.
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Buchanan	He's encouraged in his demonizing of Allied leaders and the trivializing of War Two by ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Adolf Hitler	The political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that ████████████ would have posed no further menace to Poland, Europe, or the world if only the Third Reich had been handed the Free City of Danzig in 1939.
SarahBrown	training	Buchanan	████████ holds that if those selfish Poles hadn't confronted the Nazis, drawing in foolishly meddling Britain and giddily altruistic France, no war would have engulfed the West.
SarahBrown	training	Pat Buchanan	"However, neither my friend nor ████████████ seem to have gotten the film's point: Some people hurt and kill to grab other people's land, goods, and liberty; such people dominated the Axis Powers and ""enough"" didn't appear in their vocabulary."
SarahBrown	training	Bette Davis	He and ███████████ put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors.
SarahBrown	training	George Coulouris	Mercury Theater graduate ████████████████ lends this burnt-out case's Old World cynicism an edge of desperate menace.
SarahBrown	training	Lucille Watson	██████████████ gives winsome vitality to the grasping man's hostess, a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way--but who doesn't adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls.
SarahBrown	training	von Ramme's	She and her pallid office-bound son belong to the American version of ███████████ and de Brancovis' privileged kind.
SarahBrown	training	Buchanan	This mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward National Socialism and Fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Dickie	after seeing this film for the 3rd time now i think it is almost Adam's worst film PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR in comparison to this i must say at the end when ██████ gets thrown of the boat it is so funny (the hair is different to his
SarahBrown	training	Adam Sandler	This film should only be brought if your a true ████████████ fan.
SarahBrown	training	David	The performance of the female lead is admirable; her portrayal of an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to █████'s sophisticated role was very charming.
SarahBrown	training	Lydia Reed	It is too bad that ██████████ has decided to be forgotten and not appear.
SarahBrown	training	Amos Señor Grampa	I loved it when he called █████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte Burke	███████████████ at first seems quite precocious and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child, it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing.
SarahBrown	training	Hans Zimmer	Through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones, all visually stunning with a grand score from ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Charlotte	Even in minor scenes of brilliance like when █████████ and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door, it's quite powerful.
SarahBrown	training	Donnie Darko	While there are many films I adore, there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me: films like Paperhouse, Static, Resurrection, and ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Rudd	█████████ is hilarious as always.
SarahBrown	training	Seth Rogen	I think that ██████████ should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging.
SarahBrown	training	Leslie Mann	███████████ also had some incredibly funny moments.
SarahBrown	training	Bernhard	 ████████ has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook.
SarahBrown	training	Nina Simone	███████████ comes to mind.
SarahBrown	training	Sandra	A pretty black girl attends the shows, and seems to be authorizing ██████'s faux-blackness, but ultimately rejects her.
SarahBrown	training	Sandra	Just as Catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for Christ, here ██████ depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place; as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Kiesche	First-time director ███████████ turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting, dark comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Coen	Shot on a shoestring budget, yet had the flavor of the early ████ brother's film Blood Simple ... and throw in some Monty Python flavorings to boot!
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh's	"█████████████████ ""Hamlet"" hits all the marks."
SarahBrown	training	Will S.	Oh yeah - the screenplay, by some guy named ███████, isn't too bad either.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	"Film critics ribbed Branagh for receiving the films' fourth █████ nod for ""adapting"" the screenplay, but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one."
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	The final scenes magnify the extent of ███████████'s tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	"Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is a bold, ambitious, and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of ███████████'s language with equally eloquent imagery."
SarahBrown	training	Shakespearean	It's arguably the greatest █████████████ adaptation ever filmed  strong praise, but well deserved.
SarahBrown	training	Rita Hayworth	Plus, the film is a worthy introduction for fans of █████████████...
SarahBrown	training	Jerome Kern's	Despite █████████████ collaboration with the film, his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), yet the songs serve the film well.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly's	"The dancing is nothing short of excellent, especially coming from ████████████ solo number and my favorite musical number, ""Alter-Ego Dance."""
SarahBrown	training	Rita	And ████ plays a sweet, charming girl here; a role that's a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941).
SarahBrown	training	Cole Porter	Yet the film's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters, Irving Berlin or ███████████, wrote the songs for this film.
SarahBrown	training	Rita	Just watch ████ in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.
SarahBrown	training	Sheriff Dean	The trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Dean	Then it's lets-rip-off MACON COUNTY LINE-time as ████ stalks, traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one.
SarahBrown	training	Sean Connery's	Me I just enjoyed ██████████████ character trying to make sense of the whole ordeal.
SarahBrown	training	Andy Milligan	As Blood Rites was entirely awful, I really wasn't expecting much from this film; but actually, it would seem that trash director █████████████ has outdone himself this time as Seeds of Sin tops Blood Rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation.
SarahBrown	training	gore	There's barely any ████ on display, and the director seems keener to focus on sex, with themes of incest and hatred seeping through.
SarahBrown	training	Andy Milligan	The acting is typically trashy, but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation, director █████████████ actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing, as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	"Ah, from ███████'s ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (track 2), 'got it just as I arrived at the door."
SarahBrown	training	Dimitri Shostakovich	"It's ""Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2"" composed by ████████████████████, performed here by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra."
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre Desplat	The film score by █████████████████ was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz.
SarahBrown	training	Marleen Gorris	"Director ██████████████ of ""Antonia's Line"" (1996 Academy Award's Best Foreign Language Film from the Netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without its unsettling human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family strives, lovingness and respect."
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre Desplat's	"███████████████████ lyrical film score of ""The Luzhin Defence"" is complete."
SarahBrown	training	Dominic	"The first segment of the film, titled ""Method For Murder"" tells the story of a horror storywriter, whose creation; a strangler named ""███████"" is brought to life by his own imagination."
SarahBrown	training	Peter Cushing	"The second story, titled ""Waxworks"", stars █████████████ and is my least favourite of the four."
SarahBrown	training	Phillip	Quite what the woman's relationship with ███████ entailed is never really explained, but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Cushing	█████████████ is always interesting to watch, and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Lee	This story stars the legendary ███████████████ as a seemingly overprotective father.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Lee	███████████████, as usual, portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness; the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll, and the fact that she isn't allowed to go to school or have any toys.
SarahBrown	training	Lee	The card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end, epitomised by the truly chilling line in which ███ tells his babysitter that he is, in fact, afraid of his daughter.
SarahBrown	training	Dripped Blood	Overall, if you want a horror omnibus, you really cant go wrong with The House that █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	████ is a super-skinny, geeky-looking, non-athletic teen and still comes off as super-cool due to Grace's brilliant self-deprecation of the character.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	They hang out most of the time in ████'s basement plotting, pontificating, or just plain playing around.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	█████ came back as a guest character for a few Season 5 eps.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	But, unfortunately, █████'s personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in Season 6.
SarahBrown	training	Kutcher	Grace and ███████ returned for the series finale, though, giving the show a satisfying end.
SarahBrown	training	Jim	"Annie Potts,(Kris Lansford),""Breaking the Rules"",'92,is a very warm and sweet loving wife to ███ and has complete trust in her husband."
SarahBrown	training	Kris	████ wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home with out him even seeing it for himself.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	I love ████████████ as an actor, but this stand up is some thing else.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Jackson	The take off of ███████████████ is so like him, if you close your eyes you believe it's him singing.
SarahBrown	training	Ted	Anyone that can produce comedy like Father ███ couldn't be capable of writing something not worthy of publication.
SarahBrown	training	McCoy	Fortunately for us Real █████ fans (most likely all Baby Boomers who grew-up in the late 50's and 60's), three of the adult actors/actress appeared when they did for the reunion show, in 2000.
SarahBrown	training	Little Luke	It is my understanding that ███████████ had passed away in 1999, but I'm not sure how.
SarahBrown	training	Walter Brennen	Otherwise, the retrospect on ██████████████ was wonderfully done.
SarahBrown	training	Grandpa	I remember, as a child, mimicking ███████'s gimp walk and my parents laughing (as I'm sure a million other children did back then).
SarahBrown	training	Tony Martinez	In fact, although █████████████ seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak-out and say too much during the Reunion show.
SarahBrown	training	Kamal Kapoor	Personally i was most impressed by the regal looking ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Kamal Amrohi's	The master movie maker ██████████████ lasting legacy to the sub-continent.
SarahBrown	training	haan Pakeza'	Pakeeza! ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Cousteau	This was amazingly filmed with real animals; how ████████ got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable.
SarahBrown	training	Hitler	I must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you don't understand the Italian language but I can assure you that the show-off of machism, the distortion of reality in that ever-present radio-chronicle of the ██████ visit to Rome can really make you shiver!
SarahBrown	training	Hatzisavvas	Small comment for ███████████ (plays the policeman), he is like a dinosaur, he has played a lot of roles and I'm sure that this role for him was very easy but he plays it so great that you cannot deny him a big bravo.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Smith	Thanks to ███████████, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that Return of the Jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Smith	Everyone liked Return of the Jedi until someone in a ███████████ movie made a negative comment about it.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Smith	This movie is so much better than anything ███████████ ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Smith's	Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing █████████████ opinions!
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard's	The food was quickly forgotten as I became engrossed by director and co-writer █████████████████ original and superb thriller.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Work piling up faster than she can handle it, █████ is told to hire a secretary.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	█████ is virtually deaf without her hearing aid.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Worse and humiliatingly, she accedes to a girlfriend's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in █████'s bed.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	As █████ and Paul get to know each other better, the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Ingenious Paul recognizes that █████'s ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be.
SarahBrown	training	Silvers	Each Friday they go out for oysters with Genius (███████), the club comedian.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	█████ wants her to have her success, but at the same time realizes he's lost her.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	██████████ is in a serious role here, but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing.
SarahBrown	training	Phil Silvers	████████████ is very amiable and funny as the in-house comic and best friend.
SarahBrown	training	Rusty	The only problem I had is the idea that █████ has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves.
SarahBrown	training	Jinx Falkenberg	When supermodel ███████████████, who plays herself in the film, speaks of getting married, she's warned by her boss not to, that she's too necessary to the modeling business.
SarahBrown	training	Rita Hayworth	"Nevertheless, you can't beat ""Cover Girl"" for top entertainment, beautiful color, lovely music, great energy, fine performances, and its most fabulous asset, the glorious █████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Bill Hickock	This film provides the saga of a legendary Wild ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Horace Greeley	"As the Civil War closes, Lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice, ""Go West, young man,"" which, mercifully, the film didn't erroneously attribute to ██████████████, as a number of others did."
SarahBrown	training	Wild Bill Hickock	In the meantime, we see █████████████████, who interacts with a small boy, while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the Mississippi.
SarahBrown	training	Hickock	███████ eventually meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man.
SarahBrown	training	Cody	████ has just gotten married, and is bringing his bride to the Old West to settle down.
SarahBrown	training	Hickok	With ██████'s help, they hold off the Indian attack.
SarahBrown	training	Hickock	███████ decides to go after the gun runners, and finally takes them prisoner.
SarahBrown	training	Hickock	As they're waiting for authorities, ███████ is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	██████████████ lives near me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance.
SarahBrown	training	Norman Maclean	"The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking -- I was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book, ██████████████, ""But when I am alone in the half light of the canyon, all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul, and memories."
SarahBrown	training	Stephen King	It is, however, by far the best ████████████ story that has been made into a movie.
SarahBrown	training	Stanley Kubrick	 I read that, a couple of decades ago, ███████████████ was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration.
SarahBrown	training	Stephen King	████████████ can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing.
SarahBrown	training	Stanley Kubrick	███████████████ can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	The film starts off with a lengthy scene following ████ as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	This is soon followed by the same thing following ████ and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and ███████'s traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows █████ in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner.
SarahBrown	training	Stephen King	And being a ████████████ story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when █████ is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of ███████'s movies are).
SarahBrown	training	Stanley Kubrick	One more thing that we can all thank ███████████████ for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall.
SarahBrown	training	San Salvatore	They believe █████████████, the castle they stay in, has an enchanting effect on people.
SarahBrown	training	Lottie Wilkins	"""It's a tub of love,"" says ██████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier's	"████████████████ ""Dancer in the Dark"" as tragic and operatic and over reaching as it was, worked as a musical because the musical numbers were the products of the imagination of the protagonist, an immigrant obsessed with Hollywood musicals."
SarahBrown	training	Mary Poppins	"Musicals don't work when they take their own musical-nature too seriously (like in ""Moulin Rouge"") or are simply too much fluff about nothing (i.e. something pointless like ""████████████"")."
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	"Upon viewing ""██████!"""
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	Told mostly from the point of view young ██████, I saw the musical numbers as the products of his childhood imagination and his way of coping with the horrors of ghetto life around him.
SarahBrown	training	Compton	I think it would be very interesting to see a modern update on this some how, perhaps a revisionist take on it, where people on the streets of ███████ break into happy songs about their horrible lives.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	"I'd like to see a hard-edged hip-hop version of ""██████!""."
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	I always thought ███████ would translate well in those regards.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	"As it stands, ""██████!"" was probably the last of the great film musicals and maybe the strangest G-rated film I've ever seen."
SarahBrown	training	Reese Witherspoon	Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by █████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Mulligan	███████████████ has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of ████, a raw recruit, into a police squad stationed in the Baltic area.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	They are truly down to earth, harsh at times and unforgiving, ████ on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	As days go by ████ becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating.
SarahBrown	training	Benny	The only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character █████, a 12 year old from a broken family.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	████ has her own way of patching things up.
SarahBrown	training	Benny	She turns a blind eye to █████'s shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can.
SarahBrown	training	Benny	I was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce █████'s father.
SarahBrown	training	Paget Brewster's	Of special note here: ████████████████ turn as Amy the math teacher.
SarahBrown	training	Brewster	"After seeing this performance I cannot understand why ████████ hasn't been ""discovered"" by a larger audience."
SarahBrown	training	Neil Simon	Two great comedians in a great ██████████ movie based on his hit play.
SarahBrown	training	Burns	Great combination, especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and █████.
SarahBrown	training	Matthau	And ███████ is every bit his match, if a tad more crotchety.
SarahBrown	training	Burns	And if you're a fan of either █████ or Matthau, you'll enjoy it, too.
SarahBrown	training	Verhoeven	The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about █████████'s film, the better.
SarahBrown	training	Heinlein	Little do most know, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of ████████'s death.
SarahBrown	training	Heinlein	And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of ████████'s classic.
SarahBrown	training	Verhoeven	The most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in █████████'s film.
SarahBrown	training	Carmen	Rico and ██████ have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book.
SarahBrown	training	Heinlein	████████'s political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed.
SarahBrown	training	Klendathu	The big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on █████████ between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.
SarahBrown	training	Heinlein	Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Zoinks	I was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the ██████!
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Vonnegut	I haven't yet read the █████████████ book this was adapted from, but I am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of ████████'s novels.
SarahBrown	training	Mother Night	If ████████████ has a problem it's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times.
SarahBrown	training	Van Damme's	Did not know what to expect from from ███████████ partner & friend /trainer/
SarahBrown	training	Van Damme's	"It was nice to see him act as ""TONG PO"" in ""Kickboxer and other ███████████ films."
SarahBrown	training	Qissi	In this one █████ is the action director and lead bad guy and he's good.
SarahBrown	training	Debra Winger's	Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not just for ██████████████ affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	Mr. █████ will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	The character of Scrooge as played by Mr. █████ seemed to jump off the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	He could portray the sour and crusty Scrooge, and a misunderstood, sympathetic ███████ all in the same scene.
SarahBrown	training	Picard	That's because Captain ██████ and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation.
SarahBrown	training	Picardo	Not only is ███████ such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best!
SarahBrown	training	Endgame	"Endgame portray him as a husband married to an ""organic"", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before ███████, to disobey Captain's order and make ""human"" mistakes."
SarahBrown	training	Kate	oh, if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank God for ████!
SarahBrown	training	Peter O'Toole	Having seen the █████████████ version recently, I was ready to be awed by the smart writing in this version.
SarahBrown	training	Preminger	█████████ was true to the myths surrounding her death, and I appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames reaching up and burning her.
SarahBrown	training	John Gielgud	████████████ performed outstandingly.
SarahBrown	training	Graham Greene	And, whether █████████████ does this deliberately or not, St. Joan is such a self-assured little upstart, you almost but not quite, are glad she meets her come-uppance.
SarahBrown	training	St. Joan	████████ should have turned Buddhist and quieted the 'voices in her mind'.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Mitchum	██████████████ slopes into wide open town looking for his wife and news of their daughter, and stays for a time as town-tamer.
SarahBrown	training	Mitchum	What's fascinating about this film is ███████'s cynically intense portrayal in going about cleaning the town of baddies, and the townsfolk's acceptance that his violent methods were the only ones.
SarahBrown	training	Amanda Bynes	"I have watched ████████████ since ""All That"" she is truly a funny girl, what is the best about her comedy is that its so natural and what i mean about that is, its something that a person could here there best friend saying, its not rehearsed."
SarahBrown	training	Carell	██████ and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally.
SarahBrown	training	Carell	██████ remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie you're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell	I think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the Office and ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Family Guy	A lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you'd see on ██████████, too.
SarahBrown	training	Jessica	plus ███████ is just all kinds of hot!!!!!
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	 You know the story already, ██████████ is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters.
SarahBrown	training	Claude Monet	It sounds as if it should be a biography of ████████████
SarahBrown	training	Francois	There are no parents or teachers to speak of, no school, and boys are represented by one peripheral figure, the hunky ████████ who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused.
SarahBrown	training	Pauline Aquart	██████████████ is the youngest of the three, only aspiring to join the team she so much admires.
SarahBrown	training	Adele Haenel	████████████ is older -- more, well, more developed physically.
SarahBrown	training	Francois	No wonder ████████ is always sniffing after her.
SarahBrown	training	Blachere	There's not so much ambiguity in Louse ████████'s character.
SarahBrown	training	Blachere	████████ is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance.
SarahBrown	training	Adele	█████ is the girl the others envy.
SarahBrown	training	Francois	On top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all, from the handsome but dumb ████████ to the bus driver she wants a favor from.
SarahBrown	training	Adele	NOW █████ would REALLY like to get it on with a man, preferably older and experienced.
SarahBrown	training	Adele	"█████ steps back, smiling, and says, ""There now, that wasn't so bad, was it?"", and then walks back into the club."
SarahBrown	training	Pauline	Is she USING ███████ the way she seems to be using men?
SarahBrown	training	Adele	Does it satisfy █████ to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude?
SarahBrown	training	Louise Blachere	I've slighted ███████████████ as the third member of the trio, the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity, but I've only skipped her for considerations of space.
SarahBrown	training	Anakin	7-The return of ██████ to the good side of the force.
SarahBrown	training	Sayonara	Having borrowed this movie from the local library a couple of weeks ago intending to originally see this on or a few days after Memorial Day, I finally got to seeing ████████ just this morning.
SarahBrown	training	Hispanic Montalban	Even seeing ██████████████████ playing an Oriental isn't too embarrassing (though it's a good thing his part is short).
SarahBrown	training	Brando	And there's some nice touches of humor like that of ██████'s head hitting the top of Button's and Umeki's inside doorway more than once.
SarahBrown	training	Ana	"The main thing is the alternate worlds concept which is brought on by ███'s impending illness, and the way she manages to link with someone else after being so ""alone"", and finally with her family, which I believe is still at least a little troubled."
SarahBrown	training	Ana	"It only can be called a horror movie in that it has frightening scenes but is a fantasy (with a little hint of ""coming of age"" only because ███ is a pre-teen who ""hates boys"")."
SarahBrown	training	Hannah	When ██████ goes to Berlin to visit the older woman who helped her mother during the war, the movie gets much much better.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	████████████ is one of the funniest comedians ever - probably THE funniest.
SarahBrown	training	Delirious	█████████ is hilarious!
SarahBrown	training	Henry Bromell	Remarkable debut for first-time writer/director █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	█████████'s first serious drama is a remarkable movie.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	But the Academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give █████████ any respect.
SarahBrown	training	Winfrey	Since I'm from Chicago, I had already known ███████ from her talk show (which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide).
SarahBrown	training	Goldberg	Like ████████, what a film debut!
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	Why Academy voters were so hard on not nominating █████████ for Best Director is a mystery that still puzzles me today.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	"But █████████ would eventully go on to win two Oscars years later for ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", making him one of the best movie directors of all-time."
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Smith	█████████████████ is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick 'Creep'.
SarahBrown	training	Smith	Though some bad reviews have slated this film, I truly believe that on a tight budget and for a UK production from first time director █████ that 'Creep' truly does live up to its name.
SarahBrown	training	Sykes	It was almost as if the █████ character was on the edge of madness, just awaiting the trigger.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	I haven't read this book, but all through the movie I was awestruck with only one thought in my head: This is so ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	This movie had the same complexities found in ████████'s novels: the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and the dramatic events and symbols were often also jokes.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	"He had all of the earmarks of a ████████ ""hero"": lack of concern for political boundaries, ironic dark humor giving way to dumb inactivity in response to stress, and an unwillingness to push his version of reality on those around him."
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	"It was the same feeling I had reading ""Cat's Cradle,"" my first ████████ novel, as if the most perfectly oddball thing that could happen, he thought of THAT, and he made it real and important."
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	The animation was actually excellent, like ███████'s dream.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	███████ and Itchy only just lacked the same sparkle, but I loved King Gator and his song.
SarahBrown	training	Annabelle	"Some of the film is very haunting, like █████████'s ""You can never come come back"", which kind of scares me still."
SarahBrown	training	Bethany Cox	███████████
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino	Has █████████ ever been in a bad movie?
SarahBrown	training	Pacino	██████ is an American Olivier.
SarahBrown	training	Pacino	Not only is ██████'s performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks.
SarahBrown	training	Dalarna	It both criticizes and honors the lifestyle of ███████, and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more opened minded and care more for your closest friends and relatives.
SarahBrown	training	Maria Blom	Thank you ██████████!
SarahBrown	training	Brian Fuller	I'm not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of ████████████ but I certainly enjoy his productions.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay	█████ is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay	 The movie really belongs to █████.
SarahBrown	training	Soha	████ is pretty but did not speak much in the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Cecil B. DeMille	"""The Plainsman"" represents the directorial prowess of ████████████████ at its most inaccurate and un-factual."
SarahBrown	training	DeMille	Truly, this is the world according to ███████ - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.
SarahBrown	training	Youtube	I knew some of the scenes from ███████ videos that I found by random browsing.
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard	Writer/director ███████████████ very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions, turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk), using visuals as sensory reactors as well.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	At first EVERYONE in the cast from ████ to Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look what they accomplished.
SarahBrown	training	Hong Sang-Soo	"If this is any indication, than █████████████ really is ""Asian cinema's best kept secret""."
SarahBrown	training	Sophia Coppola	"I would have a hard time believing that ██████████████ wasn't directly influenced by this film for ""Lost in Translation"" (scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself, and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties can't help but seem familiar)."
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey	On a side note, ████████████ makes this movie great.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dicken's	The immortal ████████████████ story has been recreated in every possible way imagine.
SarahBrown	training	Alistair Sim	I admit I have not seen the classic ████████████ version
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	I believe that if ███████ himself had created his story for film this would be it.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	███████████████ is absolutely, undeniably perfect for this role.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	█████ delivers the role of perfection when it comes to Scrooge.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens England	This is a grand epic of Victorian England, ███████████████ is recreated before our very eyes, the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market.
SarahBrown	training	Clive Donner	Director ████████████ brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	███████ wrote this story for a dark period in England's life and it's one of the few Christmas tales that is really dark, almost scary, and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around.
SarahBrown	training	David Attenborough	On the narration: yes everyone in the UK - very much including me - adores ██████████████████, and there's little excuse for him not to be narrating here, but that hardly deserves knocking down a star or three.
SarahBrown	training	Judd Apatow	There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I come to expect from the man (███████████) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Rudd	"█████████ proclaiming, ""If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down,"" is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate."
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carrell	And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of █████████████ singing along to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.
SarahBrown	training	Carrell	The movie doesn't portray ███████ as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin.
SarahBrown	training	Apatow	That was certainly ██████'s intention.
SarahBrown	training	Loves Me	This, despite not being the original - it began life as a play in Central Europe - has weathered the several incarnations that followed (MGM's own remake with period songs In The Good Old Summertime, the Broadway show She ████████, even the excellent theatre revival in Paris a couple of years ago) and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat.
SarahBrown	training	Edward G. Robinson	Great scenes with ██████████████████: going to the council (made up of elderly Jews with heavy accents, so it seems), where the truth is revealed.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	There is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting: █████ had hoped for a well-groomed, genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and Paul is a coarse, unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk.
SarahBrown	training	Audiard	Director ███████ wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story: he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments.
SarahBrown	training	Grady Harp	██████████
SarahBrown	training	Schneebaum	"I read ██████████'s book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of ""otherness"" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life."
SarahBrown	training	Schneebaum	Even so, ██████████ himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.
SarahBrown	training	John Gielgud	The late Sir ████████████ was a wonderful addition to this.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled ██████ were all equally hilarious.
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike	"""Yokai Daisenso"" is a children's film by █████████████, but as you might expect, it's probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones."
SarahBrown	training	Gamera	"One quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city...says one, ""Oh, it's only ██████""."
SarahBrown	training	Yokai	 The young boy has befriended █████, which are monsters of a kind, mostly benign, that have isolated themselves away from humans, and all the Yokai in Japan band together to fight the evil.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	Cool & fun stuff, kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just █████..and what a wild ride.
SarahBrown	training	Dostoyevsky	This is yet another adaptation of ███████████'s White Nights with a tiny bit of borrowing from Le Notti Bianchi (very tiny though - Ankush keeps the lovers apart by telling the boyfriend she is dead!).
SarahBrown	training	Jama Masjid	The Delhi settings are wonderful - there is the obligatory run through old Delhi, shots of ███████████ from a roof top, Connaught Circus, streets with rickshaws (What?
SarahBrown	training	Abhay	 The more I see of █████ the more I like this young man.
SarahBrown	training	Soha	████ looks beautiful, and when she smiles she fits the role, but I found her unconvincing in the more serious moments.
SarahBrown	training	Himesh Reshammiya	The music by █████████████████ is not that great and in fact the movie falters at the songs, they kind of interrupt the narrative and do not sit well with the characters trying to sing them.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay Deol's	BTW - the fact that I love ████████████ cute dimples has NOTHING to do with my rating.
SarahBrown	training	Reich	 Nor does service to the █████ as a female detainee whose husband is on the Ostfront will learn.
SarahBrown	training	Lady Bush	 Lest you think this is typical German brutishness we in America today have █████████ imperiously ordering the arrest of Gold Star Mothers (mothers of US service-members killed in action) because their very presence is offencive.
SarahBrown	training	Ruth	Fortunately the eight year old daughter ████ escapes capture.
SarahBrown	training	Hannah	I did deem it interesting that ██████ wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the Ostfront.
SarahBrown	training	Ramon	"The only major fight scene in ""Beat Street"" was when graffiti artist █████ (which in the movie was abbreviated as ""Ramo"") is chased by a rival gang member on the New York City subway tracks.....fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail."
SarahBrown	training	Sugiyama	Mr ████████ is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour.
SarahBrown	training	Sugiyama	 One day Mr ████████ sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy.
SarahBrown	training	Sugiyama	There is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when ████████ and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps.
SarahBrown	training	Hugh Dancy	██████████, also from the stage, doesn't bring much edge to the somewhat clichéd role of an unhappy rich wastrel, and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow.
SarahBrown	training	Morgan Freeman	Winning Actor ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	James Earl Jones	 Narrated by the great ████████████████, Earth doesn't offer anything new to anyone who has watched the Discovery Channel in the past five years or follows the Global Warming crisis very closely.
SarahBrown	training	George Fenton	There is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Mourikis	████████ is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well...
SarahBrown	training	Lambropoulou	████████████ is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency...
SarahBrown	training	Shemp	This is apparently one of █████'s first shorts with the Stooges.
SarahBrown	training	Moe	"Or watch the real object prompting ███'s exclamation, ""Oh...highly polished mahogany!"""
SarahBrown	training	Emil Sitka	██████████ is at his bewildered goofiest.
SarahBrown	training	Shemp	For █████ aficionados, this is a must have episode.
SarahBrown	training	Bart Allan	He finds that ██████████ has returned to Smallville and they meet each other in Kent Farm.
SarahBrown	training	Aquaman	"In this episode, the Justice League begins its saga with the association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, The Flash (""Impulse""), ███████ and Cyborg."
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The third and last part of the ██████ trilogy (duh), is lacking a bit in the story department, but covers it with extensive action scenes!
SarahBrown	training	Damon	The director and star (█████) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story-wise.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Funnily enough I read, that this adaptation of the ██████ books is the least accurate of all three films .. if that means anything to you :o)
SarahBrown	training	Eugene Logan	I am looking on the Internet how to order this movie since my former father-in-law, ████████████, the co-writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him.
SarahBrown	training	the Judas Syndrome	I call it ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	James Bolam	Widower ███████████ cannot come to terms with his wife's untimely death.
SarahBrown	training	Denis Waterman	Lothario ██████████████ is learning to accept his role as grandfather.
SarahBrown	training	Alun Armstrong	And even obsessive ██████████████ is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and keep taking the medication!
SarahBrown	training	Amanda Redman	While █████████████ has to face the all-too-familiar conflict between having a life and a career.
SarahBrown	training	Beatles	This is the closest you will get to a ███████ concert today.
SarahBrown	training	Ella Enchanted	 In case you don't want to read further down the page (there aren't any spoilers), I'll sum it up here: It's more mature than ██████████████ (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne Ultimatum	By the end here (August), I was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that I averted seeing ████████████████ in favor of Stardust.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	Having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by Transformers for my Fiction addiction, the previews of ████████ seemed appealing, but I was certainly wary.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	████████ didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was I sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom.
SarahBrown	training	Princess Bride	It's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (██████████████, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.)
SarahBrown	training	Marion	"They appear together in cheap comedies until ██████ is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic star."
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	A must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned █████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Polly Moran	███████████ is a maid.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Ralli	██████████ is the slimy leading man.
SarahBrown	training	Swanson	Davies and ███████ were friends.
SarahBrown	training	Haines	Davies and ██████ were huge MGM stars and friends.
SarahBrown	training	Greta Garbo	███████████ and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear.
SarahBrown	training	Agusti Villaronga	The latest film by the Spanish director █████████████████ is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community, develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty.
SarahBrown	training	Pedro Almodovar's	The cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the Spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow Spaniard █████████████████ work with themes dealing with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff Hardy	Next I feel Regal should have got back his European title, ██████████ is a crappy champ.
SarahBrown	training	Roy	All the animals are very likable and funny , and even Sigfried and ███ had their moments .
SarahBrown	training	Stephen Sachs	"Your average garden variety psychotic nutcase (deliciously essayed with unhinged glee by █████████████) knocks off various dim-witted young ""adults"" (to use the term very loosely) in Dayton Hall University, which is being closed down for demolition."
SarahBrown	training	Ann Dvorak	"By 1933 she was in limbo - having played ██████████ as a child in ""Three on a Match"" (1932) and a ""flower girl"" in both ""This Side of Heaven"" and ""The Key"" both in 1934."
SarahBrown	training	Anne Shirley	She also adopted ████████████ as her stage name.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	████ was so right for the role of the chatty, heartwarming orphan.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	That ████ is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke, in fact, as it is a curiosity.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	Carell, a veteran of Team Ferrell in Anchorman and an ex-Daily Show castmember, uses the concept of the film to expand his character  we get to understand why ████ is the way he is.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	When ████ rides his bike to work, he signals his turns.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	The plot is fairly simplistic  ████'s co-worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman.
SarahBrown	training	Judd Apatow	The 40-Year-Old Virgin was directed by ███████████, the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy, and began the short-lived cult TV show Freaks and Geeks.
SarahBrown	training	Carell	Apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor, and the script  co-written by ██████  offers plenty.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	We like ████.
SarahBrown	training	Woody Allen	His neurotic traits combine the best of ███████████ with childish naivety.
SarahBrown	training	Andie MacDowell's	█████████████████ performance was nuanced and vulnerable.
SarahBrown	training	Kate	The romance between ████ and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well.
SarahBrown	training	Imelda Stalinson	████████████████, who has been a MVP in so many British films, does a great job in this.
SarahBrown	training	Vladimir Navokov	The literary genius of ████████████████ is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice.
SarahBrown	training	Alexander	The director puts us in check mate with the story of █████████, an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction.
SarahBrown	training	Nastasya	████████ is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted.
SarahBrown	training	Alexander	She meets █████████ by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket.
SarahBrown	training	Alexander	Thinking █████████ reached his peak, abandons him but becomes legend.
SarahBrown	training	Nastasya	████████, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves.
SarahBrown	training	Alexander	Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots, its low back cut dresses are lovely, █████████ plays his role sublimely.
SarahBrown	training	Nastasya	████████ is a great match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her.
SarahBrown	training	Navokov	The Luzhin Defense elegantly gives ███████ honor, the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.
SarahBrown	training	oliver	i'm really getting old,,am in the midst of watching this 40 year old flick,and wonder what my grandchildren will be watching 40 years from now,,its an old saying,,but they don't make em like that anymore..it's not only the story,its the music,the acting both by young and old..the cast ,it would seem,were born to play their roles,,young oliver,,old Fagin..too many to mention them all,the role played by the judge ██████ stands before,i've seen in other roles over the years..the artful dodger,,Ron moody as Fagin,,Mr and Mrs bumble,,the movie not only won 5
SarahBrown	training	Stormhold	The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between England and a magical kingdom known as █████████.
SarahBrown	training	The Princess Bride	If I had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be ██████████████████, a classic.
SarahBrown	training	Truman Capote	Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on author █████████████, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion.
SarahBrown	training	Capote	The 1967 film version of ██████'s work is almost as remarkable as the book itself.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Blake's	This is the film on which ██████████████ reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Brooks	Director and writer ██████████████ guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	Yet █████████ is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Eustache	Director █████████████ is not as well known as other directors from the New Wave, but he should be.
SarahBrown	training	John Cassavetes's	There is no improvisation (unlike in █████████████████ similar films made in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations.
SarahBrown	training	Francoise Lebrun	For example, ████████████████ was a former lover of Eustache.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character █████ was based on, did too.
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	The anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by ████████ delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Landon Jr.	I love all of the movies by ██████████████████
SarahBrown	training	Dale Midkiff	████████████ has the ways to pull off this character.
SarahBrown	training	Clark	How they dealt with the death and how █████ helped them do so was that of a fathers love.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Landon Jr.	██████████████████ is an excellent director I look forward to many more movies from him in the future.
SarahBrown	training	Sheila	The peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when ██████ expresses the desire to have their older child attend the Protestant school.
SarahBrown	training	Sheila	"The local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this ""sin"" and soon has ██████'s husband and the entire Catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father, the local dairy farmer."
SarahBrown	training	Sheila	In an act of defiance and desperation, ██████ kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the area.
SarahBrown	training	Sheila	Special note should be given to Orla Brady who plays ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Mann	I've just finished listening to the director's commentary for this film, and I think the one big thing I got from it that I agree with is that this film, like ████'s The Insider, is completely subjective.
SarahBrown	training	Howard	It's from ██████'s POV.
SarahBrown	training	Howard	"If you feel, as he did, that the film ""does not work"", then you're saying, I think, that ██████ does not work."
SarahBrown	training	Howard	██████'s reasoning and personality really wouldn't stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Greengrass'	Like the second entry in the series, I wished ████████████████ shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The ██████ films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	and we finally learn the truth about ██████'s past.
SarahBrown	training	Damon	It's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense, and █████ gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.
SarahBrown	training	Dicken	This is simply one of the finest renditions of ██████'s classic tale.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	The script very accurately follows the story originally penned by ███████, and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	███████████████ brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of Scrooge, and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts.
SarahBrown	training	Carol	The superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all the Christmas █████ versions I have seen.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	Filmmakers like today's █████████, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox.
SarahBrown	training	Kyle	████ is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house.
SarahBrown	training	Randy Marsh	This is a very strong ███████████ episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center.
SarahBrown	training	Randy	"But before █████ makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming ""I don't have any change!!"""
SarahBrown	training	Gerald Broflofski	Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing █████████████████ to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people.
SarahBrown	training	Randy	█████ immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head.
SarahBrown	training	Randy	When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, █████ pulls the trigger.
SarahBrown	training	Randy Marsh	The zombie movie parallels and the great ███████████ lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10
SarahBrown	training	Greta Garbo's	█████████████ first Hollywood film?
SarahBrown	training	Greta Garbo	███████████ must have just shocked the studio people as much as she did me, because this film made her a star, and deservedly so.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	It is only the performance of █████ as Leonora, the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who got away, that gives it life.
SarahBrown	training	Ricardo Cortez	Co-star ██████████████ is serviceable, but his character is never really developed and he is demeaned by the script throughout.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	At one point he is made to wear █████'s clothes, leave in a huff, then ignominiously return and give them back.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	And let's not even talk about his horrible final scenes with █████ and then his wife.
SarahBrown	training	Leonora	But he suffices as the somewhat mystifying object of ███████'s obsession.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	If you really want to know what it's all about without seeing the whole film, just watch the last 30 seconds or so - █████'s glance as she sits quite alone in her luxurious car says everything.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	"""She must be so happy, she has everything she wants"" - yes, █████'s face says it all about that."
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	I have to see this one again, █████ is just amazing.
SarahBrown	training	Vance	"""But █████,"" Markham says, ""do you mean to tell me a dead man walked upstairs?"""
SarahBrown	training	Vance	"""I'm not trying to tell you anything but the facts,"" █████ says."
SarahBrown	training	Archer Coe	Wealthy, arrogant ██████████, disliked it seems by all who knew him, had been found slumped in a chair in his bedroom, pistol in his hand and a gunshot wound to his head.
SarahBrown	training	Coe	Further examination shows ███ had been hit hard by a blunt instrument that fractured his skull.
SarahBrown	training	Coe	███ was no suicide; this was murder.
SarahBrown	training	William Powell	Second, is the amusing, assured performance of ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Vance	Few things escape █████.
SarahBrown	training	Powell	██████ was a star in the Twenties and moved steadily upward in status and popularity when the talkies took over.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	████'s parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade.
SarahBrown	training	Donna	█████'s parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy.
SarahBrown	training	Hyde	████ is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents.
SarahBrown	training	Eric	I highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of ████.
SarahBrown	training	Julian	██████ is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	█████, the quintessential nice guy, is dealing with some stuff in his own life and, truth be told, could use a friend as well.
SarahBrown	training	gore	First of all, the killing and ████ is implied but never really shown in any detail, meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you.
SarahBrown	training	Matador	And second, unlike most anti-hero films, ███████ makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character.
SarahBrown	training	Julian	██████'s job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing.
SarahBrown	training	Julian	Did ██████'s victims deserve to die?
SarahBrown	training	Julian	The focus is on ██████ and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship.
SarahBrown	training	Julian	If you read about someone like ██████ in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer, but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity.
SarahBrown	training	James Bond	He doesn't completely divorce himself from his ██████████ good looks and smooth charm, but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	The films only other major role, that of █████, is not nearly as meaty.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Broson	█████████████ is amazing in his role as a hit man, who suddenly becomes burned out & asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for help.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce	The movie will have you laughing as ██████ delivers hilarious one liners (mostly about sex).
SarahBrown	training	Pierce	The imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially at the bullfight scene & when ██████ sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Blake	████████████ walks away with the film.
SarahBrown	training	Dick	Based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy, In Cold Blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural Kansas family one cold, windy night, because ████ has bought into an age-old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home.
SarahBrown	training	Will Geer	"As ""prosecutor"" (a character that isn't given a name in the script), played by █████████, so astutely points out, their lives are bought for only $10 a head."
SarahBrown	training	Dick	████ is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime, only irritation at Perry's.
SarahBrown	training	Dick	Indeed, after they are caught, it is ████ who breaks first, and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime.
SarahBrown	training	Dick	A large cargo truck located to the left front of ████'s Pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed, but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle.
SarahBrown	training	gore	 As I previously stated, this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema, not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence (no actual in your face ████ as a modern film would resort to), but a thoroughly excellent film.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt(Joey Lawrence	██████████████████) plays the part of the oldest sibling and takes on the more fatherly role.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings Builds	"In ""Mr. ████████████████ His Dream House,"" there may, therefore, be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948."
SarahBrown	training	Levittowns	Finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience, only lightly softened by the coming of ██████████ and the like.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	The █████████ children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school (which in real life would get teachers accused of communism).
SarahBrown	training	Myrna Loy	In real life, too, █████████ was a housing activist, a Democrat, and a feminist.
SarahBrown	training	Jason Robards	█████████████, sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable.
SarahBrown	training	Jason Robards	More importantly, his son, █████████████, jr., would be for many years a very active liberal Democrat.
SarahBrown	training	Cary Grant	Almost the odd fellow out was ██████████, whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping.
SarahBrown	training	Soll	████ is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way The South was back then.
SarahBrown	training	Soll	I suppose that if ████ lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.
SarahBrown	training	George Lopez	████████████ never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't.
SarahBrown	training	George Lopez	If you are looking for a good, traditional comedy, then ████████████ is the show for you!
SarahBrown	training	George Lopez	████████████?
SarahBrown	training	Will Smith	"Imagine the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air being ""██████████""."
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	My favorite character is ███████ but I find Itchy's voice is so fun to hear.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	Although some scenes I actually found scary, I still have a hard time watching the scene with ███████'s dream, and Carface scares the crap out of me.
SarahBrown	training	Hannah	██████ easily persuades the woman to tell her story.
SarahBrown	training	Margarethe von Trotta	The quality of acting is generally quite good, what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and the direction of █████████████████████, New German Cinema's most prominent female filmmaker, herself a former actress.
SarahBrown	training	Adolf Eichmann	Because these Jews had German relatives, many of them highly connected, ██████████████ hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied Poland.
SarahBrown	training	Rosenstrasse	But before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case, wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the ████████████ address, first in ones and twos, and then in ever-growing numbers.
SarahBrown	training	Dudley Moore	████████████ is charming, lovable and rich.
SarahBrown	training	John Gielgud	Sir ████████████ is aristocratic, charming and loving...and poor.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	The two have a non-father/father and son relationship which defines the man whom ██████ is to become.
SarahBrown	training	Miller	 Judge ██████
SarahBrown	training	Philo Vance's	Detective █████████████ powers of observation seem greater than all the Oriental sleuths of the era combined when it comes down to that final evaluation of how the murders were committed.
SarahBrown	training	Kelley	I can picture DeForrest ██████ watching the film and saying to himself - 'I'll have to use that sometime'.
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard	███████████████ the director must be making quite a name for himself in France, and rightly so.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	I have yet to see a film with █████ in it that I did not like.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	█████ has a a full range of acting talents.
SarahBrown	training	Chaplin	Had ███████ lived in our times....who knows, he just might as well have become an aficionado of CGI tools.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	I have not read the ████████ novel from which this film comes to the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	█████'s character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts.
SarahBrown	training	Alan Arkin	The acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out ██████████, always fantastic, is very good in a small role.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	█████ gives one of the finest performances you can expect....the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things.
SarahBrown	training	P.J. Soles	"I liked this movie I remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where Riff Randell (played by ██████████) is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the Ramones are in the room with her sing the song ""I Want You Around"" ...very very cool stuff."
SarahBrown	training	Daniel Jackson's	They finally brought ████████████████ search for his wife to an end and finally most of the Go,ould System Lords were killed by rival Lords, SG-1 or others.
SarahBrown	training	Produer Peter Deleuise	With the new writers and the close attention by ██████████████████████, the show became more and more solid.
SarahBrown	training	Jack O'Neill	Colonel ████████████ was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Dean Anderson	The character offers little growth for any actor and actor █████████████████████ chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself.
SarahBrown	training	Carter	Though this character had little area to grow, Tapping has done a great job of concentrating on ██████'s strengths.
SarahBrown	training	Carter	She has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things ██████ talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher	 ███████████ Judge joined the cast playing the alien Teal'c.
SarahBrown	training	Jaffa	Teal'c was an alien called the █████.
SarahBrown	training	Jaffa	Infant Go'ould, (snake like creatures) would embed themselves into the █████ until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form.
SarahBrown	training	Jaffa	The █████ would die.
SarahBrown	training	Jack O'Neill	Finally, having had enough, he and ████████████ freed their team along with quite a few innocent people.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher	███████████ Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character.
SarahBrown	training	Daniel Jackson	In the end, he became adviser to most of SG-1, especially ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	George Hammand	 Don S. Davil was there from the beginning playing Major General ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Daniel Jackson	I saved Dr. ██████████████ for last, because this character, I believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on.
SarahBrown	training	Jackson	In the early years, the ███████ character came off as a whiner.
SarahBrown	training	Jackson	In the end, as of season 10, the ███████ character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero.
SarahBrown	training	Arin	Definitely different from her soldier like character ████ Soon.
SarahBrown	training	Deep Throat	Season one's '███████████' takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in southwest Idaho.
SarahBrown	training	Ed Meecham	██████████, the zoo keeper, reminds me of cranky, old school teachers.
SarahBrown	training	Eugenia	My name is ███████ so I thought OK, lets see what this is.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Lundquist	███████████████ returns as Igor, a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long-lost true King of France.
SarahBrown	training	Mark Price	"██████████, recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the FAMILY TIES series, plays a thinly disguised version of himself, passing himself as ""Michael J Fox"" as a way to win the girl of his dreams."
SarahBrown	training	Rick Rockwell	"Another returning member of the Killer Tomatoes stock company is █████████████ (now best known as the hapless title subject of ""Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?"")."
SarahBrown	training	Jon De Bello	What can you say about ████████████?
SarahBrown	training	John	████, if you ever see this, thanks for giving us the Killer Tomatoes.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Sinatra's	In ███████████████ first three films, he was purely a speciality act: ostensibly playing himself, he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else's movie.
SarahBrown	training	Michele Morgan	██████████████ hears a knock at the door, and asks who's there.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Sinatra'	From outside, a Hoboken-toned voice answers '██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Grace Hartman	█████████████, who died of cancer at age 48, did almost no film work, so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up, to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform.
SarahBrown	training	Grace Hartman's	After ███████████████ death, her husband had a long career as a character actor, just occasionally dancing solo.
SarahBrown	training	Ken Berry	(Or alongside █████████ in one memorable episode of 'Mayberry RFD'.)
SarahBrown	training	Marcy McGuire	Also quite attractive in a maid's uniform here in 'Higher and Higher' is the vivacious teenage singer █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Betty Hutton	Perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	McGuire	The alternating strides of short ███████ and tall gawky Wickes are hilarious!
SarahBrown	training	Leon Errol	Regrettably, although ██████████ plays a large role in 'Higher and Higher', he is given almost no comedy business: not once does he do his famous rubber-legged dance.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Haley	██████████, despite his prominent billing, is also wasted.
SarahBrown	training	Wilson	In that film, ██████ did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of 'As Time Goes By'.
SarahBrown	training	Wilson	(In real life, ██████ couldn't play piano.)
SarahBrown	training	Victor Borge	████████████ gives a rare film performance here, handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows.
SarahBrown	training	Tim Whelan	Director ██████████, who worked in Britain as well as in Hollywood, deserves to be much better known.
SarahBrown	training	Rip Torn	Someone on here said ████████ was miscast.
SarahBrown	training	Clyde Stewart	He is brilliant as the dour, miserly █████████████ who says little and works like a slave/workhorse.
SarahBrown	training	Lilia Skala	███████████ is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma.
SarahBrown	training	Clark	This is not just a thrilling story about teamwork, loyalty, and friendship; this is also about deciding what's more important in life, a lesson for █████.
SarahBrown	training	Lex	In this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between ███ and the Team.
SarahBrown	training	T.D. Jakes	"Definitely recommend this one... and while you're at it, I'd like to throw in ""The Color Purple"" and ""Woman, Thou Art Loosed"" by ██████████."
SarahBrown	training	Sandy	Well, this might be one of the funniest movies of all time, and █████ gives a tour-de-force performance!
SarahBrown	training	Diana Ross	She dons into different personas from New York socialite to ██████████ to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in America.
SarahBrown	training	Charles	"""Oh, ███████,"" she said, ""I'm Jewish."
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	"How could you make up such a character like █████?!"""
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	"He's a model for █████ and he was Jewish."""
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	 ███████ found that did not settle things.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	"█████ does."""
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	███████ had to admit that he might have gotten carried away.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver Twist	████████████ was published in several editions.
SarahBrown	training	Charles	"""███████, what changes - he's still a vile villain called ""the Jew""!"
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	"███████ smiled as though he was brilliant, ""He is cooking a pork sausage for his dinner."""
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	███████ never totally shook off his own bigotries, but the situation did lead to a partial attempt at amends in his last completed novel.
SarahBrown	training	Riah	In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND (1865) he has a minor character, Mr. ████, who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents from poor tenants.
SarahBrown	training	Riah	The landlord figures that Mr. ████ will be blamed because he is Jewish.
SarahBrown	training	Riah	But Mr. ████ is a good man.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	The anti-Semitic image of █████ lingers to this day.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	It is a measure of ███████' genius as a writer that the novel overcomes it.
SarahBrown	training	Carol Reed	Sir ██████████, in his musical version of the novel did it better yet, due to a rewrite in the original musical's script.
SarahBrown	training	OLIVER	██████ had been made into a West End musical hit in the middle 1960s, and then taken to Broadway where it was again a hit.
SarahBrown	training	Lionel Bart	"With a wonderful score by ███████████, including ""Food Glorious Food"", ""I Am Reviewing the Situation"", ""Consider Yourself"", ""Boy For Sale"", ""Who Will Buy"", ""As Long As He Needs Me"", it deserved it's success."
SarahBrown	training	OLIVER	██████ won it in 1968.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	And █████ - how to handle the eternal problem of the caricature?
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	Well in the musical █████ is not captured, tried and executed for the murder that is committed.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	After all, even Lean showed █████ tried to control his confederate in his actions.
SarahBrown	training	Fagin	But here █████ realizes that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of chancy life.
SarahBrown	training	the Artful Dodger	He is allowed to do so, accompanied by his faithful acolyte, █████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	I don't think ███████ would have appreciated the change (his female friend might have), but a modern audience certainly accepts it as fitting.
SarahBrown	training	Erik	This movie shows the very strong, often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children, ████ and Sabriye.
SarahBrown	training	Erik	████ is an American blind mountain climber/athlete and Sabriye is a blind German academic who started a school in Lhasa Tibet.
SarahBrown	training	Murderball	If you liked Spellbound or ██████████, you will love this.
SarahBrown	training	Montand	███████ must absolutely find the killer...and what a great ending!
SarahBrown	training	Mitchell Leisin	I first came across this film when I read a book (written in the 1970s) about the career of ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	CAREY	"It's true that twice standards appeared in his films, but they were really rare cases: ""Cocktales for Two"" appeared in MURDER AT THE VANITIES, and ""Mona Lisa"" came out of CAPTAIN █████, U.S.A."
SarahBrown	training	CAREY	"""Mona Lisa"" was the only tune in CAPTAIN █████."
SarahBrown	training	Lombard	The song (sung by ███████) about how her lover's playing thrills her, is important to the plot.
SarahBrown	training	Franklin Pangborn	She is constantly being bullied by her boss █████████████████ (the ship's barber).
SarahBrown	training	Leisin	Their first scene together has a nice ██████ touch in it: MacMurray is talking to Lombard, she on the deck of the boat and he on the edge of the wall of the lock.
SarahBrown	training	Dorothy Lamore	"The film follows the rise and fall of the Skid Johnson (MacMurray) as he meets Lombard, and begins his reputation as a trumpet player, but meets the ""other woman"" in the film, ██████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Lamore	██████ has little to really do - possibly the film had more scenes with her in it, but one stands out is her attempt to get MacMurray onto the wagon again.
SarahBrown	training	Carl Judels	Rarely noticed in films, small part actor ███████████ is effective as a fair weather fan/friend of MacMurray, who drops him as he goes under (though he gives him a hand-out).
SarahBrown	training	Charles Butterworth	███████████████████ is as trivial in this film as usual, but he does have one moment when he looks sheepishly at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he, his girlfriend, MacMurray, and Lombard share - his red faced appearance is due to embarrassment about a lie that MacMurray is insisting is true.
SarahBrown	training	Cecil B. De Mille	The master of movie spectacle █████████████████ goes West.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Quinn	Look out for a very young █████████████ essaying the role of an Indian brave who participated at the battle of Little Big Horn.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	It is beautifully, if conventionally, animated; the highlight being the captivating scene where the Fairy Godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and ██████████'s rags to a gorgeous gown.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	It is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of ██████████ and her friends, moving the viewers to care for them.
SarahBrown	training	CINDERELLA	Overall, Walt Disney's ██████████ is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century.
SarahBrown	training	Cecil B. DeMille	"After the failure of ""The Crusades"" at the box office, ████████████████ stopped doing films about non-American history."
SarahBrown	training	Lee	Lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that ███ has surrendered.
SarahBrown	training	Maximillian	It was Reconstruction that occupied his attention, not the west (except for the problems of ███████████ and his French controlled forces in Mexico against Juarez).
SarahBrown	training	John Pope	"In 1862 he sent disgraced General █████████, the loser at Second Manassas, to Minnesota to put down a serious Indian war by the Sioux (the subject of McKinley Kantor's novel, ""Sprit Lake""."
SarahBrown	training	Cooper	"However, with all Lincoln's actual attention to western problems, it is doubtful that he says (as ██████ repeats at least once), ""The frontier should be secure."""
SarahBrown	training	Teddy Roosevelt	"Like saying, ███████████████ said, ""Eat a good breakfast every morning for your health."""
SarahBrown	training	Jackie	"A typical dialog is this: ""Fez: Oh, ██████ I want to have sex with you."
SarahBrown	training	Jackie	██████: Fez you're a pervert.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Capano	he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; in this case, portraying attorney (and murderer) ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Rachel Ward	We are sorry for the situation, but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women (including ███████████) as well.
SarahBrown	training	Olympia Dukakis	There is a cameo with ███████████████ (excellent) as Capano's mother.
SarahBrown	training	Ann Rule's	All in all, an interesting story because it is based on a true murder, and you will want to read ██████████ book to get the accurate details.
SarahBrown	training	Rosencrantz	Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and ███████████ are Dead.
SarahBrown	training	Simba	We find out what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow █████ back to Pride Rock to oust Scar.
SarahBrown	training	Hakuna Matata	With more laughs than any other third-in-a-Disney-series movie, █████████████ is worth watching - if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Words echoed, so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention-mind you there's no ███████████ here!,just simple talk.
SarahBrown	training	Indy	"The word ""████"", is thrown around as if it's a Genre.."
SarahBrown	training	Paul	"-""The long and winding road"" rendition,a key moment,when ████'s voice cracks ,as he is moved to tears by the hearts the members of the tour crew hold in front of the stage."
SarahBrown	training	Dan Seymour	███████████ almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature.
SarahBrown	training	Seymour	███████ wasn't a small actor.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay Doel	"The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and ""convincing"" ██████████ does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a ""normal"" and ""third class"" guys(as he calls himself in the movie)."
SarahBrown	training	PRemchand	The story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of █████████ munshi.
SarahBrown	training	Clint	█████ as lawman is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts some cartels saying the following :
SarahBrown	training	¨ Warning	█████████ , wearing of guns or other weapons in town is banned.
SarahBrown	training	Clint	But the town council afraid the raw methods carried out by █████ .
SarahBrown	training	Tollinger	At the end the kingpin landowner appears and attempts to murder █████████ with his own hands.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Mitchum	Phenomenal and great role for ██████████████ as avenger angel and bitter gunfighter, he's the whole show.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay	█████ is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene.
SarahBrown	training	Soha	████ looks so sweet in the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Himesh	Music and all songs are good, ██████ is impressive as an Singer here.
SarahBrown	training	Abhay	█████ best work till date.
SarahBrown	training	Leon Erroll	███████████ is silly, as always, but overall pretty funny.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	War breaks out, and without much hesitation █████ signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty.
SarahBrown	training	Veronica	He cannot even say good-bye to ████████, for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	Surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract █████' attention must inevitably fail.
SarahBrown	training	Mark	His brother ████, a vigorous musician, who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption, is eager to take his place.
SarahBrown	training	Veronica	████████ initially resists, but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms.
SarahBrown	training	Veronica	Again ████████ is among them, forcing her way through a wall of bodies.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	In her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers, until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers, for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of █████' death.
SarahBrown	training	Veronica	But now ████████ is watching them on her own, and the look in her eyes is a different one.
SarahBrown	training	David Beckham	I had never even seen █████████████ before this film.
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	'██████████' is a love story.
SarahBrown	training	Loretta	███████'s family.
SarahBrown	training	Loretta	How this story and love stories of ███████'s parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself.
SarahBrown	training	Cher	Every seen is a delight to watch, with ████ as the bright star in the middle of everything.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	She won and really deserved the █████ that year.
SarahBrown	training	Tony Hawk Pro Skater	Underground introduced the storymode, which was very cool because it made a whole new world for ████████████████████ fans.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	As a long-time student of ████████'s works, I have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers, at least to those that love him as I do.
SarahBrown	training	Nolte	The casting is inspired: █████ is understated in triumph, bewildered in defeat, decisive in judgment.
SarahBrown	training	Alan Arkin	██████████ delivers a totally lovable, but equally treacherous, Soviet spy.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Vonnegut's	Watch, also, for ███████████████ cameo near the end of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Bing Crosby's	"█████████████ ""White Christmas"" will never sound the same (I write in mid-December, when the song is getting heavy radio play, and it's driving me nuts)."
SarahBrown	training	Ben	And, it would have been impossible for ███ to have arrived in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100-square mile ranch in the next twenty years.
SarahBrown	training	John Ford	█████████ was using Native American actors in the 1920s.
SarahBrown	training	Mark Twain	In Season 1, ██████████ appears, and he is depicted as a middle-aged man.
SarahBrown	training	Mark Twain	██████████ was 24 years-old in 1859.
SarahBrown	training	Pernell Roberts	I don't think ███████████████ ever got the credit he deserved.
SarahBrown	training	Denard	Unfortunately for ██████ he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the Falagists of Spain.
SarahBrown	training	Bacall	It was ██████'s second film, and (sad to say) almost sank her long career.
SarahBrown	training	Boyer	█████'s mission never succeeds, as he has too many hidden foes all over the place.
SarahBrown	training	Dan Seymour	With ███████████ as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou (and the man who destroys her).
SarahBrown	training	Stewart Granger	███████████████ loses his British safari hunter stereotype to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best.
SarahBrown	training	Granger	███████ is haunted by the buffalo he has killed, knowing that he may be to blame if they become extinct, knowing if they become extinct, the Native American way of life will greatly suffer.
SarahBrown	training	Taylor	██████ soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic saidism, unlike the one dimensional sadists of modern film, created by nerds and dorks.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	█████ sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	█████ insinuates herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	█████ is not phased out by that reputation.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	As a little girl, I wanted nothing more than to be ██████████ with her glass slipper- it was my absolute favorite costume.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	Honestly, I don't think there is any story that more realizes the longings of the human heart than ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lady Tremaine	█████████████ is evil to the T, in a wonderfully calculating, not overtly physical way.
SarahBrown	training	Gus	The animal friends tend to grate, especially that idiotic ███.
SarahBrown	training	Lucifer	I would have cheered had he met his fate in ███████'s jaws.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ herself was no pushover- making some justly catty remarks at times.
SarahBrown	training	Cindy	It seems the only reason things work out in the end for █████ is that everything sort of falls to place in her lap.
SarahBrown	training	Ilene	█████ woods has a lovely, rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine.
SarahBrown	training	William Shatner	The episode's humorous take on the topic is rather successful, weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest (of course, everything works out fine again come the end) and the cast's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves (most notably, and ironically, the otherwise hilarious ███████████████).
SarahBrown	training	John Candy	The scene I speak of, comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict shackled to ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	John Candy	As time went on, the cast was whittled down To ██████████, Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy.
SarahBrown	training	David Steinberg	Director ███████████████ has razor sharp timing, and he must have been laughing all through this.
SarahBrown	training	Candy	As for █████, who's basically in charge here, he has NEVER been funnier.
SarahBrown	training	John Drew Barrimore	 It is riddled with weaknesses, ███████████████████ the most glaring.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Elams	Its right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff, and goes to ██████████ place trying to goad him into a fight.
SarahBrown	training	Amanda	8 years after shooting her sexually abusive step father ██████ is released from the psychiatric ward, with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with.
SarahBrown	training	Amanda	But within the first 20 minutes of the movie ██████ kills him and buries him in her backyard.
SarahBrown	training	Richard	Then she see's her neighbor ███████ sets eyes on him and stops at nothing until she has him.
SarahBrown	training	Amanda	And you'll have to rent the movie to find out if ██████ dies or not.
SarahBrown	training	Drew Barrymore	██████████████ is at her best in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Lindsay	Everything is going pretty well until ███████ has a false alarm having missed her period.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	"Eventually ███ tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends birthday Party after she said ""I had to check my calender and when I saw the there was a Red Sox/Yankee game I knew I would be going stag'."
SarahBrown	training	Ben	After the party ███ tells her it was 'the best night of his life'.
SarahBrown	training	Lindsay	███████ finds out through a friend and decides to stop him realizing he is doing it for her.
SarahBrown	training	Lindsay	It ends very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball has been over shadowed for a whole new deeper love, ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Dennis James	We were fortunate enough to have ████████████, a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the Mighty Wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film.
SarahBrown	training	Greta Garbo's	This was █████████████ first American film.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	█████, with all her subtlety, did much to usher in the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	Even though this is █████'s first American film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands:
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	There are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was █████.
SarahBrown	training	Hammer	Featuring a few of ██████'s all-stars, this highly effective slice of British horror revolves around a house and the fates of it's previous tenants, whose stories are all told to a Scotland yard detective, in search of a missing actor.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic	He creates a demented character named ███████, who's a very creepy looking strangler, and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes.
SarahBrown	training	Lee	Well come to find out...if she knew what ███ did, she would have certainly understood.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Henderson	After buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant, actor ██████████████ finds himself turning into the very creature that he's portrayed several times in his career.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	Academy Award winner ██████████████ (Best Director.
SarahBrown	training	Norman Macleans	Ordinary People 1980) captures the majesty of the Montana wilderness and the strength of the American family in this acclaimed adaptation of ███████████████ classic memoir.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Skerritt	Growing up, both boys rebel against their stern Minister father (████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Norman	While ██████ channels his rebellion into writing, Paul descends a slippery path to self-destruction.
SarahBrown	training	Henry Comstock	The area became known as the Comstock Lode because another character, ██████████████, had the reputation of trying to jump everyone's claim and the area became known as the Comstock Lode.
SarahBrown	training	Mark Twain's	Other episodes dealt with ████████████ literary rise while a reporter for the Territorial Enterprise...
SarahBrown	training	Charles	After a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house, ███████ begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife.
SarahBrown	training	Lee	That part alone is the main reason why this one works, and ███ doesn't harm it either.
SarahBrown	training	Craig	How was '█████' created and what happened to him?
SarahBrown	training	Neil Simon's	████████████ THE ODD COUPLE set up a model for many of his later plays.
SarahBrown	training	Willie	"First Al had little habits, such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter ""t"", and slightly jabbing ██████ with his index finger, on stage."
SarahBrown	training	Al	Secondly, ██ retired when his wife died.
SarahBrown	training	Willie	But ██████ can't remember lines unless they are funny, and keeps flubbing them.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	███ is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about American Comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Willie	He does bring Al to see ██████, and the sparks begin flying, as neither can figure out what the other is doing (and this is just in rehearsal.
SarahBrown	training	Willie	"On top of that, ██████ is insisting on changes (minor ones, but they throw off Al) such as saying ""ENTER!!!"""
SarahBrown	training	Al	when ██ knocks on the door.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	The initial rehearsal is a failure, but ███ manages to get them to the taping of the show.
SarahBrown	training	Benjamin	████████ strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle, although Matthau's rough outer shell makes it difficult (he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville).
SarahBrown	training	Burns	Matthau has a little better grasp on reality (at first) than █████, who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality Matthau's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly.
SarahBrown	training	Burns	█████ is not senile - he takes things slowly.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Benny	██████████ was.
SarahBrown	training	Benny	█████ probably would have done a good job, but ill-health forced him out (he died in 1975).
SarahBrown	training	Burns	"█████ (whose last involvement in any film was in THE SOLID GOLD CADILLAC in 1956 as the narrator) turned in such a fine performance that he got the ""Oscar"" for best supporting actor, and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as OH GOD!;"
SarahBrown	training	Gracie Allan	He died in 1996 age 100, having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Philo Vance(William Powell)to	The film starts in the Long Island Kennel Club where is murdered a dog,later is appeared dead as a case of committing suicide a collector millionaire called Arched,but sleuth debonair █████████████████████████████ be aware of actually killing.
SarahBrown	training	Vance	The police Inspector(Eugene Palette)and a coroner are helped by █████ to investigate the mysterious death.
SarahBrown	training	Agatha Christie	The personages are similar to ███████████████ stories, all they are various suspects.
SarahBrown	training	Nick Charles	He's protagonist of two famed detectives cinema,this one, and elegant ████████████ along with Nora(Mirna Loy)make the greatest marriage detectives.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Curtiz	The movie is magnificently directed by Hollywood classic director ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Philo	█████ Vance¨(1940).The film is a good production Warner Bros, by Vitagraph Corp.
SarahBrown	training	gore	The movie is great, funny, crazy, over-the-top violent though with minimum ████, and all the way energetic to the core.
SarahBrown	training	Jackie Chan	Very thankful to our Russian industry for the releases of classic ███████████ movies.
SarahBrown	training	Dan Seymour's	I love █████████████ acting -- he usually plays some plump foreign sultan or police chief and appeared in Casablanca and many great pictures.
SarahBrown	training	Sammo Hung	"This, ""Prodigal Son"" and ""Eastern Condors"" are my favourite ██████████ films."
SarahBrown	training	Sammo	A sequence in which █████'s pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Chow	The director/actor's assault on ██████████ and a house filled with angry, menacing opponents is a bone-cracking, physically punishing delight.
SarahBrown	training	Perry Smith	What stands out the most in my memory is ███████████ going to the gallows.
SarahBrown	training	Saki	The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (!) woman, ████ (Ryoko Yonekura) on a Harley, and the location is in a town somewhere in Japan.
SarahBrown	training	Ryoko	█████ handles her guns with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due.
SarahBrown	training	Musashi	"She shows her acting skills much more as Otsu in the NHK drama, ""███████."""
SarahBrown	training	a Ryoko Yonekura	"I'd highly recommend film if you're ████████████████ fan (which I adoringly am) and/or a ""girls with guns"" movie fan"
SarahBrown	training	Ryoko	And to have a gorgeous gal like █████ starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake.
SarahBrown	training	Ester Williams	A French film ██████████████ would love.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	█████ is a stick of a girl, unattractive, but determined.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	However, this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely & entertaining story, quite faithful generally to ███████' novel.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	First of all, ███████████████ can certainly seem pretty crotchety and doesn't make a bad Scrooge.
SarahBrown	training	Marley	 ██████'s anguished ghost (with his wonderful jaw dropping scene) and the three Spirits are all quite convincing.
SarahBrown	training	Janet	I like the nephew's wife, whom they've named █████, with her lovely, sprightly period hairstyle.
SarahBrown	training	Tiny Tim	Above all, this version has unquestionably the best ████████, not only an adorable & endearing little waif but sickly.
SarahBrown	training	Farrely	The ███████ brothers did a great job capturing that and it made for good comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Eva Mendez	██████████ plays a head-strong, success-starved network TV programmer that took a joke made by a co-worker while brain-storming TV program ideas about Russian Roulette seriously.
SarahBrown	training	Helen	At the other end of the scale, there is the unfortunate █████ who is married to a wealthy man of high estate, but is exposed to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect.
SarahBrown	training	Toby Stephens	Finally, I could watch this film for █████████████ alone; he is so good-looking,rugged, sexy, sensitive (but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way).
SarahBrown	training	Anne Bronte's	Not only did I puchase the video (a rare occurrence), but it led me to buy █████████████ superb novel.
SarahBrown	training	Ebenezer Scrooge	That has somehow slipped past one ████████████████, merchant and money lender in 19th century London.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	As his nephew points out to his uncle, he doesn't keep Christmas in any way because ███████ feels the whole thing is humbug.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver Twist	A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as ████████████ was.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver Twist	The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in ████████████, but they are having to struggle to stay up there.
SarahBrown	training	Bob Cratchit	Still love and happiness radiate their home, no thanks to the guy ████████████ works for.
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Stewart	███████████████ in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	But ███████████████ captures the old miser pretty well in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Oscars	This movie should have won ██████ for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses.
SarahBrown	training	Aoki	Don't get me wrong, it is 100% Japanese (and that is what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it is just a great laugh at one of the main characters called Mr. ████ - one of the funniest characters I have ever seen!)
SarahBrown	training	Mos Def	"The hip hop rendition of a mos def performance (according to the film's musical credits)...it is an incredible piece of savage consciousness that slams the violence in your heart with each ""snap"" if anyone can tell me someplace this song, ""Live Wire Snap"" by ███████ from ""The Ground Truth"", an undeniable duty to see as the Americans who might not support the mission but embrace each soul caught inside this savage miscalculation of purpose...they take on the haunting as so many of us can sit back and be angry..."
SarahBrown	training	Mos Def	"""Live Wire Snap"" by ███████, where can it be found desperate to find it : medically unable to serve"
SarahBrown	training	Alvin Sanders	"But █████████████, the man who the feds have ""volunteered"" to be implanted with the device, is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while."
SarahBrown	training	Alvin	█████ even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem.
SarahBrown	training	Sergio Martino's	"In my humble opinion this is actually ████████████████ finest giallo, and that has got to mean something, as ""The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh"", ""All the Colors of the Dark"", ""Torso"" and ""Your Vice is a Locked Room and only I have the Key"" are all top-notch genre achievements as well."
SarahBrown	training	Lisa Baumer	Following her husband's peculiar death in a plane explosion (!), ███████████ promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and she's eager to leave the country as soon as possible.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Lynch	Due to the bizarre circumstances, the insurance company puts their best investigator ███████████ on the case and he follows her to Greece.
SarahBrown	training	Lisa	There, ████ becomes the target of many assaults and the case's mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money.
SarahBrown	training	Sergio Martino	Many red herrings follow after that, but ██████████████ always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and, even though not a 100% satisfying, the denouement is at least surprising.
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Nicolai	It's also a very stylish film, with imaginative camera-work and excellent music by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	George Hilton	The charismatic and hunky █████████████ is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and  duh  ladies' man deluxe.
SarahBrown	training	Nettie	Celie has a younger sister ██████ with whom she is inseparable.
SarahBrown	training	Nettie	A widower lays his eyes on ██████ but their father gives Celie to him.
SarahBrown	training	Celie	█████'s story is a true survival story.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	"""The Color Purple"" is a master-piece and underestimated film of █████████."
SarahBrown	training	Schindler	"He should make more drama which ""The Color Purple"" and ""█████████'s List"" are good notion."
SarahBrown	training	Danny Glover	"████████████ was surprisingly nasty ""Mister""."
SarahBrown	training	Oprah Winfrey	The talk-show icon █████████████ is brilliant as a strong-willed Sofia.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	Big applauds to Mr. █████████!
SarahBrown	training	Chloe Franks	Trivia Note: ████████████ appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc, and when I saw her I felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldn't quite put my finger on it.
SarahBrown	training	Agatha Christie's	"Later, on reading her filmography, it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of █████████████████ ""The Mousetrap"" in London's West End, which my brother and I were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the Summer of 2002!"
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Lee	" ""The Cloak"": a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre, while inventing some new ones!) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and, at one point, ███████████████ himself!"
SarahBrown	training	Drew Barrymore's	I got this film about a month ago and I am now a fanatic fan of ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lindsey dating	This then leads in the Ben(teacher) and ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Jeanette Francessca	Screenwriter ███████████████████ has a good line to the story that works.
SarahBrown	training	Karl Marx	May I have the temerity to state that if █████████ saw this movie he'd love it and call it a masterpiece ?
SarahBrown	training	Andy Bailey	There's also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former IRA man ███████████ who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former IRA member ( That makes a change .
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	Even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the █████████' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Hanks	"Obviously, Hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice - first as a very physical █████████ comedy, 1986's ""The Money Pit"", and again last year with Ice Cube's ""Are We Done Yet?""."
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	This sparks the █████████ to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first.
SarahBrown	training	Jim Blandings	With his double takes and flawless line delivery, Grant is infallible in this type of farce, and █████████████ epitomizes his more domesticated mid-career characters.
SarahBrown	training	Muriel	She doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make ██████ an appealing character on her own.
SarahBrown	training	Lilja	"Last year I saw ""█████ 4-ever"" that tells an identical story in the former Soviet Union; therefore this problem does exist in Third World countries."
SarahBrown	training	Rudi Lagemann	Director and writer █████████████ presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes.
SarahBrown	training	Fernanda Carvalho	It is the debut of the promising █████████████████, who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival.
SarahBrown	training	Darlene Glória	Most of the prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous ██████████████ so different she is after many plastic surgeries.
SarahBrown	training	Cambpell Scott	While listening to an audio book, ██████████████ is the reader.
SarahBrown	training	Ahab	████ no not really
SarahBrown	training	Henry	█████ is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.
SarahBrown	training	Betty Boop's	He wants to get a puppy from ████████████ pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue.
SarahBrown	training	James Arness	████████████ is a great actor and he showed it here.
SarahBrown	training	Raul Julia	Another great actor in this move was ██████████, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complex person who led Mexico through turbulent times.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Brosnan	██████████████ is flat-out hysterical in this self-effacing role.
SarahBrown	training	Kinnear	███████ is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying.
SarahBrown	training	Harold Becker	But I have to say that before even getting to the story itself I was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City that Director █████████████ created.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Anselmo	For example there's a reference to Woerner's Restaurant in Brooklyn where political boss █████████████ likes to eat.
SarahBrown	training	Nicholas Pileggi	No surprise because the script was co-authored by ████████████████ who still writes both political and organized crime stories.
SarahBrown	training	Aiello	He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do ██████ in.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Franciosa	 City Hall was the farewell performance on film for █████████████████, one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Al Pacino's	███████████ best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed, he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself.
SarahBrown	training	- Ed	████
SarahBrown	training	- Cait	██████
SarahBrown	training	Wook	If you have seen ████'s previous works/movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here.
SarahBrown	training	Ed Hunt	"Writer/director ███████, the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey ""Starship Invasions,"" the uproariously inane Jesus Christ vigilante parable (!)"
SarahBrown	training	Julie Brown	"And, yes, that's none other than ███████████, the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise Top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune ""The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun,"" as the lovely, vacuous, full-breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy, totally extraneous, yet still sizzling and much-appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song!"
SarahBrown	training	Lars Von Trier	██████████████ is never backward in trying out new techniques.
SarahBrown	training	Leo Kessler	With so many cities lying in ruins, ███████████ a young American of German descent feels obliged to help in their restoration.
SarahBrown	training	Urmitz Leo	At a station called ██████████ jumps from the train with a parceled bomb.
SarahBrown	training	Lars Von Trier's	Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, I prefer ████████████████ later films (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots).
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	And I feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Tristan	The main character, ███████ (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie.
SarahBrown	training	Tristan	When there is a falling star ███████ promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with.
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	████████████ is also an easy target.
SarahBrown	training	Stone	In addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by █████, this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines to go along with Stone's sexy curves.
SarahBrown	training	Katherine Tramell	"""█████████████████ is bisexual...how shocking!"""
SarahBrown	training	RAYMOND MASSEY	My only minor quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful ██████████████ is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene.
SarahBrown	training	Goring	██████ has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish.
SarahBrown	training	Technicolor	The ███████████ photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is excellent and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness.
SarahBrown	training	Donner	By this time around, the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and, happily to say, with this film ██████ not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	He tells the story with precision and an eye to detail, and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative, especially █████.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	There is such a purity and honesty in his Scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen █████ do it; simply put, he IS Scrooge.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	And forever after, whenever you think of Scrooge, the image your mind will conjure up will be that of ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Iwerks	That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where ██████ continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog).
SarahBrown	training	Iwerks	The bright tonalities allowed ██████ to create a more visually appealing film, and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney, creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before.
SarahBrown	training	Iwerk	Being a musical film, this is of high importance, and so the mediocrity of the music brings down █████'s flawless work of animation.
SarahBrown	training	Iwerk	"Despite its shortcomings, ""Skeleton Frolics"" is a very funny and visually breathtaking film, that while not exactly the most original and fresh film (one just can't help but thinking of ""The Skeleton Dance"" while watching it), it definitely reminds us that █████'s skeletons are still here to haunt us, and inspire us."
SarahBrown	training	Lucianna Paluzzi	"My abiding love of Italian actress ████████████████, who helped jump-start my puberty with her performance in 1965's ""Thunderball,"" has led me to some fairly unusual places."
SarahBrown	training	Lucianna	"Case in point, this British curiosity from 1959, ""Carlton-Browne of the F.O.,"" which features ████████ in one of her earlier roles."
SarahBrown	training	Artemisia	█████████ is a wonderful film and I think it brought many people (including some that now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
SarahBrown	training	Pumbaa	Okay, it adds some stuff, like where Timon came from and how he and ██████ met, but it's an interesting concept.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Guillame	Everyone does well, especially ███████████████ (is that how you spell it?)
SarahBrown	training	Boris Karloff	"When I purchased the █████████████ collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role (""Tower of London"", ""The Strange Door"")."
SarahBrown	training	Boris Karloff	This actually would have been a great title for the █████████████ collection instead!
SarahBrown	training	Janos Rukh's	The first one, set in Dr. ████████████ Carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer's patience, but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Rukh	"There Dr. ████ isolates himself from the group, discovers the essential element ""Radium X"" to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself."
SarahBrown	training	Karloff	███████ glows in the dark and, convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life, he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch.
SarahBrown	training	Lambert Hillyer	The story is rather far-fetched but nevertheless compelling and director ███████████████ provides several moments of sheer suspense.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	Their scenes together are the highlights of the film, along with the funky images of the glowing █████.
SarahBrown	training	Winston Sharples	Color, animation, music (the great ████████████████), editing, voices.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Verry classic plot but a verry fun horror movie for home movie party Really ████ in the second part This movie proves that you can make something fun with a small budget.
SarahBrown	training	Crawford	████████ stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother.
SarahBrown	training	Crawford	████████ becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: -The Rescue of Han Solo from █████: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.
SarahBrown	training	Luke Confronts	The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) ██████████████ his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3)
SarahBrown	training	Lando	The Destruction of the Second Death Star (█████'s Moment) -The
SarahBrown	training	Spencer Tracy's	Sandwiched in between San Francisco and Captains Courageous two of ███████████████ greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people.
SarahBrown	training	Alvin C. York	But █████████████ was never changed by the war the way Tone has.
SarahBrown	training	Gladys George	Wounded in the fight Tone convalesces at a hospital with █████████████ looking out for him.
SarahBrown	training	Tracy	█████'s brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage, but takes sit in stride.
SarahBrown	training	George	He's a hit-man now and ██████ doesn't really know what he does for a living.
SarahBrown	training	Gladys George	The part of the film that gave me some trouble is that I can't believe █████████████ couldn't figure it out.
SarahBrown	training	James Cagney	She's a street smart girl, her part is very much like the one she played in The Roaring Twenties opposite ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Humphrey Bogart's	Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, █████████████████ character development there is similar to Tone's although he was not the central character of the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Clint Eastwood's	In fact there are elements of They Gave Him A Gun that are to be found in Taxi Driver and in ████████████████ classic, The Unforgiven.
SarahBrown	training	Woody Van Dyke	 The World War I battle sequences are very well staged by director ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Leonard Maltin	For some reason ██████████████ panned this film, I think it's a lot better than he gave it credit.
SarahBrown	training	Karel Zeman	This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great Czech filmmaker, ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Zeman	If one were to look at █████'s work and try to compare it to any of the other sci/fi fantasy films of the time, viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either.
SarahBrown	training	Zemen	"It is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day, because both █████ and Hines ""do not compute""."
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	As the movie goes along it's like ███████ only cares about himself just like his character in the Naked Spur.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	This is one of ███████'s better westerns.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur Mathews'	███████████████ scripts cheekily parody a number of that era's icons - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even the infamous 'Oz' obscenity trial of the early '70's.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Russell's	I think this is ██████████████ best movie.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Harling	██████████████ penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of MAD Magazine, but feels like a gift to us in the audience.
SarahBrown	training	Celeste	The daytime Emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to ███████'s show, The Sun Also Sets.
SarahBrown	training	Celeste	Against all vain fears to the contrary, ███████ wins again.
SarahBrown	training	Celeste	She is the head writer of the show, and she and ███████ have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years.
SarahBrown	training	Celeste	"But ███████ has doubts: ""I thought that the Dalai Lama moved to LA."""
SarahBrown	training	Fernando Lamas	"""-Well, then, some other lama, ██████████████, come on!""."
SarahBrown	training	Rod Randall	Of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character, ███████████, was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago.
SarahBrown	training	Geoffrey Anderson	Somehow they work out the logical difficulties, and █████████████████ steps off the choo-choo.
SarahBrown	training	Celeste	███████ can now only get worse, and her trick of going across the Washington bridge no longer helps.
SarahBrown	training	Geoffrey Anderson	Unfortunately, she cannot get rid of █████████████████ so easily.
SarahBrown	training	Geoffrey	████████'s been promised development of his one-man play about Hamlet, and he means to hold the producer to that promise.
SarahBrown	training	Geoffrey	""", argues ████████."
SarahBrown	training	Willie Loman	"""You try playing ████████████ in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf !"""
SarahBrown	training	Geoffrey	And indeed, seeing ████████'s dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious.
SarahBrown	training	Laurie Craven	Now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating █████████████, the show's new ingenue; so he's not leaving.
SarahBrown	training	Tawnee	Will Celeste settle her nerves, or will she kill ██████ first?
SarahBrown	training	Geoffrey	And you'll really have to see to believe how the short-sighted ████████ reads his lines without glasses live off the TelePrompter.
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	"It's one of those movies that could easily get by someone, but for romantic comedy ""██████████"" is really in a class by itself."
SarahBrown	training	Dunston	"""You're wrong Mr. ███████""."
SarahBrown	training	Jeff Webster(Stewart	████████████████████) gives off the impression he cares only for himself
SarahBrown	training	Brennan	but it is clear he cannot desert ███████.
SarahBrown	training	John McIntire	█████████████ is excellent as the law of Skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it.
SarahBrown	training	Tatum	The caption above plays on █████'s assertion that he can't live without his coffee.
SarahBrown	training	Schiffer	This ████████ guy is a real genius!
SarahBrown	training	Sofia Coppola	A bit slow (somehow like a █████████████ movie) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls.
SarahBrown	training	Caine	but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers █████ wants to be the first invisible human.
SarahBrown	training	& Caine	He manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well ███████ becomes invisible, however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible.
SarahBrown	training	Caine	The team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works, █████ slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Verhoeven	Directed by ██████████████ I rather liked Hollow Man.
SarahBrown	training	Andrew W. Marlowe	The script by █████████████████ has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original The Invisible Man (1933) film which Hollow Man obviously owes a fair bit.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Then of course there's the ████, he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits, to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Having said that I love horror/████/exploitation films so Hollow Man delivers for me, it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.
SarahBrown	training	Verhoeven	Director █████████ does a great job, or should that be the special effects boys make him look good.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Bacon	I love the effect where ███████████ disappears one layer at a time complete with veins, organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the Gorilla.
SarahBrown	training	Alec Baldwin	Walking with Cavemen, hosted by ████████████, is a look back at all the hominid (that's us!)
SarahBrown	training	Powell	██████ and Pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Livesey	 All of the performances are spot on (█████████████ being a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, never has there been a more romantic film than this (if there has I haven't seen it).
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████ is a beautiful young woman who is treated cruelly by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	One day, a ball is to be held in honor of the prince, but ██████████ has no chance of going, because her stepmother and stepsisters won't let her.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	██████████, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success, and it continues to charm audiences to this day.
SarahBrown	training	Pat Boone	█████████ behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because, unlike thoroughbred jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers.
SarahBrown	training	Pat Boone's	(Disappointing though that ███████████ religious/moral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl!
SarahBrown	training	Walter Brennan	Home in Indiana with ██████████████ (filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song) captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying
SarahBrown	training	Michael Mann	A few years ago, a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the ████████████ film 'Heat' on it.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier	██████████████ woke film noir from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war German photographs I saw.
SarahBrown	training	Werewolf	Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the ████████, Nazi post-war terrorists.
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	"""██████████"" is a movie that I liked the first time I watched it."
SarahBrown	training	Cher	████'s search for love is enjoyable to watch.
SarahBrown	training	Nicholas Cage	This film is, by far, the best job █████████████ has done on film.
SarahBrown	training	Olympia Dukakis	But, perhaps the best character is the one played by ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	███████ takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements.
SarahBrown	training	Xavier Cugat	And how often do we get The Killers and ████████████ on the same soundtrack?
SarahBrown	training	Roger Corman's	One of b- and c-movie producer ██████████████ greatest cult classics was the Ramones vehicle (originally designated for Cheap Trick), Rock N' Roll High School.
SarahBrown	training	Napoleon Dynamite	It's just a simple, technically dated story (but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made █████████████████ characters funny--see Eaglebauer's van) about teenagers who love rock n' roll.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	A Ramones fanatic, she has written some songs (including Rock N' Roll High School) that she wants to give to the Ramones, and in trying to do so, is rebuffed by Miss █████ who does all she can to keep her from going to see the Ramones play in town.
SarahBrown	training	Corey Feldman	I would recommend passing on the █████████████ vehicle, Rock N' Roll High School Forever, released nearly a decade later.
SarahBrown	training	Hitler	The beginning scenes with ██████ at Piazza Venezia with all the Italians is incredible and really places the film historically.
SarahBrown	training	James Stewart	 Aside from the love story, I must say that █████████████ is truly one of the best things about this film.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Stewart	He doesn't play the full-fledged █████████████ persona in this film (c/f
SarahBrown	training	Alfred Kralik	'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' for that); in fact █████████████ is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	He's rather a brusque man, in fact, with little hint (until, perhaps, the very end) of the aw-shucks down-home boyish charm ███████ would soon come to patent.
SarahBrown	training	Ernst Lubitsch	 ██████████████ really does himself proud with this film--for example, the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the Matuschek shop is well worth the effort, right down to the Hungarian names on the door, the wares and the cash register and so on.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Stewart	 *This* is really the █████████████ Christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	It's sweet, funny, charming, and ███████ is impeccable in his role.
SarahBrown	training	Cartwright	The series chronicles the adventures of the ██████████ family, who live on a ranch near Virginia City, Nevada around the Civil War era.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	One of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present (despite occasional disagreements) between ███ and his three sons, and (despite frequent disagreements) between the three brothers.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	███ is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity.
SarahBrown	training	Hoss	The middle brother, ████, is a gentle giant of a teddy bear, who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy around the ladies.
SarahBrown	training	Little Joe	The youngest, ██████████, is a hot headed, handsome charmer who, by contrast, has quite a way with women.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie Kaufman	For fans of Fight Club and any ███████████████ film, and required viewing for anyone who avoids multiplexes like a rabid dog.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Costner	The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last █████████████ movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	Plus, despite the promise ██████████████ showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.
SarahBrown	training	Kenny Rogers'	The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than █████████████ orange face lift.
SarahBrown	training	George Clooney	Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make ██████████████ proud?
SarahBrown	training	Costner	I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when ███████ started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Cushing	The only thing I didn't like about the film was the fact that █████████████ was wasted on the worst episode.
SarahBrown	training	Jon Pertwee	The best episode, rightfully saved for last, is the one featuring ███████████ as a horror film actor--it is really excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Pertwee	As good as ███████ was in this role, it's hard to believe he didn't do more of these types of movies.
SarahBrown	training	Van Dyke	Just a side bar on Mr. ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Dick	████ had a terrific sense of modernism when he built that house.
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	Wondering what the secret ██████ is hiding.
SarahBrown	training	Costner	Shocked to find a film starring ███████ that appealed to the soul of the audience.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	Shocked that ██████████████ could act in such a serious role.
SarahBrown	training	Costner	Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this ███████: full of depth and complex emotion.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	No, its not an █████ worthy movie.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Fallon	The only reason I saw this movie was for ████████████, who I've had a crush on since 9th grade, which was his first year on SNL.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy	I thought █████ played the role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky, and he is a nervous and quirky guy.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy	█████ and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy	I think █████ has a positive career ahead of him, and thank goodness, because Taxi could have killed it.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy	Here's wishing █████ a successful career on screen.
SarahBrown	training	Cher	████ gives a good performance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self.
SarahBrown	training	Bogdanovich	If not his best, it's my most loved of all ███████████ movies.
SarahBrown	training	Suraj Barjatya	██████████████ is best in movies on marriage.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid & Amrita	███████████████ jodi has given us hit movies earlier like Ishq Vishq, & Shikhar.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid & Amrita	A truly ███████████████ film.
SarahBrown	training	Sigrid Thornton	███████████████ is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen.
SarahBrown	training	Mia	Here ███ visits her parent for the birthday of her father, a which occasionally always have some kind of tragedy, the question is just what will it be this year, and you will be surprised...
SarahBrown	training	Mia(if	Finally you can't help falling in love with ██████ you are a boy I guess(the main actress))
SarahBrown	training	Katharina	"He falls in love for █████████, and sooner she discloses that she was a ""Werewolf""."
SarahBrown	training	Max	"When ███ commits suicide, Leopold is also pressed by the ""Werewolves"" and need to take a position and a decision."
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier	"""Europa"" is an impressive and anguishing Kafkanian story of the great Danish director ██████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Fritz Lang	Using an expressionist style that recalls ██████████ and alternating a magnificent black & white cinematography with some colored details, this movie discloses a difficult period of Germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war.
SarahBrown	training	Max	Very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country, and the corruption with the Jew that should identify ███.
SarahBrown	training	Jean-Marc Barr	██████████████ has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody.
SarahBrown	training	Max Von Sydow	The hypnotic narration of █████████████ is another touch of class in this awarded film.
SarahBrown	training	Bacall	██████ does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film.
SarahBrown	training	Humphrey Bogart	"This one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: ""To Have and To Have Not"" (1944) and ""The Big Sleep"" (1945), both of which paired her with ███████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Bacall	██████ is just gorgeous.
SarahBrown	training	Bacall	Not great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and ██████ magic.
SarahBrown	training	Muckerji	Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. ████████ is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing.
SarahBrown	training	Lorre	█████ also does quite well in his slimy, snake portrayal of Conteras - a sleazy coward to the end.
SarahBrown	training	Wanda Bendrix	█████████████ also does quite well in portraying the child Else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (though she appears much younger).
SarahBrown	training	Auie Murphy	Turns out she later married ███████████ which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous marriage.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic	This is an awesome story, with plenty of suspense, and the killer ███████ is really creepy, and it's very well acted as well!.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Duffell	█████████████ does a great job here, with awesome camera work, great angles, adding some creepy atmosphere, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!.
SarahBrown	training	John Bryans	███████████ is great here, as the narrator, he had some great lines, i just wished he had more screen time.
SarahBrown	training	John Bennett	████████████ is very good as the Det., and was quite intense, he was especially good at the end!, i liked him lots.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Cushing	█████████████ is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is likable, focused, charming, and as always, had a ton of class!
SarahBrown	training	Joss Ackland	████████████ is fantastic as always, and looked so young here, i barely recognized him, his accent wasn't so thick, and played a different role i loved it!
SarahBrown	training	Wolfe Morris	████████████ is creepy here, and did what he had to do well.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Lee	███████████████ is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is incredibly intense, very focused, and as always had that great intense look on his face, he was especially amazing at the end!
SarahBrown	training	Chloe Franks	████████████ is adorable as the daughter, she is somewhat creepy, and gave one of the best child performances i have ever seen!, i loved her.
SarahBrown	training	Nyree Dawn Porter	█████████████████ is beautiful and was excellent as the babysitter, i liked her lots!.
SarahBrown	training	Ingrid Pitt	███████████ is beautiful , and does her usual Vampire thing and does it well!.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	I wasn't old enough to see ██████ when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.
SarahBrown	training	Bill Sykes	Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,██████████ had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.
SarahBrown	training	Duffell	It's a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director ███████ and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Like virtually every production of ███████████, it has problems and it has had to make hard choices, not all of which work out.
SarahBrown	training	Ophelia	And the relationship with ███████ seems a little forced.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	But in a staging of ███████████, it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Lemmon	███████████).
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	███████████████ as the Player King - who would have thought it?!
SarahBrown	training	Heston	"(A story is going around that ██████ once played Hamlet on stage, and when a critic in the front row couldn't stand his hammy acting and said out loud, ""This is terrible!"
SarahBrown	training	Heston	""", ██████ reportedly retorted right from the stage: ""Well, I didn't write this crap!"""
SarahBrown	training	Heston	Of course it may not be true, but it's a funny story - and if true, a bold and ironic choice for Branagh to include ██████ here.)
SarahBrown	training	Robin Williams	"██████████████ as ""Young Ozric"" is perhaps not young enough for the part, but he makes it a comical one, which is warranted."
SarahBrown	training	Derek Jacobi's	All things considered, I must pronounce Branagh's Hamlet to be my favorite one, with ██████████████ 1980 BBC version a close second.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	I probably like Branagh's ███████████ work more than most, finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer, with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Branagh, I believe, brings out a truer ███████████ than the world has yet seen.
SarahBrown	training	Ishai Setton's	It's hard to believe this is ██████████████ first film.
SarahBrown	training	Cunningham	The film is a delicate mood piece and the script by Minot and ██████████ is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons.
SarahBrown	training	Lajos Koltai	"████████████ (""Being Julia') directs."
SarahBrown	training	Grady Harp	Judge this film on your own.... ██████████
SarahBrown	training	Thnks	█████ before.
SarahBrown	training	Quentin Tarantino	 Park kinda reminds me of █████████████████ with his irreverence towards convention.
SarahBrown	training	Walt	████ really out did him self here.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	The strange twists in the ████████ story are made stranger by odd details.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	This was a great vehicle for ████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Chandler Jarrell	He appeared to have a great time with his part as ████████████████ and he should never care about what the critics say, if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it!
SarahBrown	training	Murphy	And, it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr. ██████'s great comedic style.
SarahBrown	training	J. L. Reate	 ███████████ - but after looking at his profile in IMDb, I noticed that he never did any more films.
SarahBrown	training	Victor Wong	I also adored ███████████, who played the Old Man (I LOVED him in his part as 'Egg Shen' in 'Big Trouble in Little China' - 1986).
SarahBrown	training	Chandler	The only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature  such as '████████'s rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette.
SarahBrown	training	Jeffrey Wright	I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lamhey	After watching DDLJ, Saajan, and ██████, I really thought that Bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that - EVER.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid Kapor	After all everyone who has seen ████████████ know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor.
SarahBrown	training	Amrita Rao	██████████, for the first time came across as someone to be remembered.
SarahBrown	training	Rani	Move over ████ 
SarahBrown	training	Sonali	(yes people I will challenge you find even 0.1% fat on her and unlike so many others like ██████ she can actually act too).
SarahBrown	training	D.W. Griffith	By 1909, █████████████ had been directing films for the Biograph Company for about a year, and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker.
SarahBrown	training	Edgar Allen Poe's	"The simple narrative was probably inspired by █████████████████ 1846 short story, ""The Cask of Amontillado,"" and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wife's infidelity."
SarahBrown	training	Henry B. Walthall	However, unbeknownst to the king, his wife has fallen in love with the royal minstrel (█████████████████).
SarahBrown	training	D.W. Griffith	█████████████ always had an eye for acute detail, and 'The Sealed Room' is an excellent early example of this.
SarahBrown	training	Griffith	In the early minutes, ████████ restricts his shots to lengthy long-takes from a stationary camera (as was usual at the time), but soon  parallel to the progressively darker subject matter  he alters his editing tactics in a fascinating way.
SarahBrown	training	Griffith	"Though he may not have invented the technique, ████████ was crucial in popularising the use of ""cross-cutting""  that is, alternating between different events occurring at the same time."
SarahBrown	training	Arthur V. Johnson	The acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect, however, at least in the case of █████████████████, his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king.
SarahBrown	training	Ludlum	Though all three films could not be any more different from the ██████ novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The ██████ Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Greengrass	███████████████ has done it again.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Everything we love from the previous ██████ films is here once again: the action, the dialogue, and of course the shaky camera.
SarahBrown	training	Moon	The Man in the ████.....we'll
SarahBrown	training	Farrelly	If I'd known it was a ████████ brothers movie I would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it, but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie.
SarahBrown	training	Crispin Glover	If you are a ██████████████ fan, you must see this.
SarahBrown	training	Sean Penn	If you are a █████████ fan, you must see this.
SarahBrown	training	Patricia Wymer	"Lead actress ██████████████, as the titular ""Candy,"" gives the finest performance of her career (spanning all of 3 drive-in epics)."
SarahBrown	training	Patricia Wymer	██████████████, where are you?
SarahBrown	training	Miss Wymer	"Hailing from Seattle, WA, ██████████ had appeared as a dancer on the TV rock and roll show MALIBU U, before gracing the cover (as well as appearing in an eight-page spread) of the August, 1968 issue of ""Best For Men,"" a tasteful adults-only magazine."
SarahBrown	training	Edgar Allen Poe	This movie is 11 minutes long (about average for most films back then) and is a variation of the ███████████████ story, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.
SarahBrown	training	Principal Togar	"(Let me assure you I've been out of high school for, uhhh, some years and it's not following me).....the famous ""static"" line (""I'm getting some static"".....""Not as much as you're going to get"", as Principal Togar approaches).....the school board member who is so decrepit he's attended by nurses....the Nazi Hall Monitors love for a ""body search"" ......███████████████ announcing, ""I give you the final solution"", and burning the Ramones records (note: records were what came before CD's) ...."
SarahBrown	training	Joey Ramone	Just one piece of advice.....don't look up where the stars are now.....███████████ sadly died young.
SarahBrown	training	Dick Cavett	The whole thing is an obvious satire on the Health movement, filled with over-top, outlandish, contradictive characters, with guest stars like ███████████ providing a wry commentary on the whole thing.
SarahBrown	training	Altman	Underlining the whole election process is ██████'s characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having.
SarahBrown	training	Altman	This would be one of ██████'s last films like this for a while!
SarahBrown	training	Leopold	███████ soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption, being taken advantage of, losing his ideology, and is forced to chose between pest or colera.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier's	These are some immediate, grandiose, descriptions that come to mind when thinking of ████████████████ 1991 masterpiece EUROPA; the final chapter of the Europa trilogy.
SarahBrown	training	Agnieszka Holland's	In USA it was retitled ZENTROPA so audiences wouldn't confuse it with ███████████████████ EUROPA EUROPA from 1990 (equally a WWII drama).
SarahBrown	training	Andrei Tarkovsky	EUROPA utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style -- that famous Russian director ████████████████ is Trier's main-influence says it all.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Spielberg	According to rumors this inspired ████████████████ to use the similar effect in SHINDLER'S LIST from 1993 (coincidentially another WWII drama).
SarahBrown	training	Stanley Kubrick's	EUROPA is often criticized for weighing advanced technique (such as multi-layered background-projection) above plot and characters, but hey that's what reviewers criticized █████████████████ 1968 visual masterpiece 2001:
SarahBrown	training	Trier	Apparently █████ assigns the Nazis' Werewolf terrorist-group too much historical significance.
SarahBrown	training	Trier	According to various online-sources that's correct (a fascinating subject - try Googl'ing it yourself!), yet █████'s purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately.
SarahBrown	training	Leopold Kessler	███████████████ is hypnotized, therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality.
SarahBrown	training	Trier	It's right up there with other █████ classics and semi-classics such as FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT from 1984, the TV-series RIGET from 1993 and DOGVILLE from 2003.
SarahBrown	training	Trier	It's a unique experience from before █████ cared for his actors, and before the Dogme95 Manifesto.
SarahBrown	training	Chori Chori Chupke Chupke	......... and you get █████████████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Julie	The topic was accepted but it is far from Jism, Murder, and █████.
SarahBrown	training	Rani	The movie picks up once ████ has her miscarriage where you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie.
SarahBrown	training	Salman Khan	███████████ sometimes impresses, and sometimes lets you down.
SarahBrown	training	Rani Mukherjee	██████████████ was adequate.
SarahBrown	training	Preity Zinta	Throughout the movie, you feel for her character the most, but she is overshadowed by ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Preity Zinta	████████████ is picture perfect.
SarahBrown	training	Dil Tera	The title song is my favorite of them all along with ████████ Mera Dil (Hearts).
SarahBrown	training	Diwani Diwani	Preity's cabaret number, █████████████ (Crazy), could've been shortened while No. 1 Punjabi came across boring though it had good dancing.
SarahBrown	training	Jamie	█████ keeps running into the Julio and whats his name.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Pastorelli	And just how could █████████████████ dig up Yankee Stadium to hide the gold.
SarahBrown	training	Kimberly Elise's	I enjoyed ████████████████ performance, she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously.
SarahBrown	training	Gackt	█████ and staff are very serious when made this film, and they worked so hard.
SarahBrown	training	Hyde	This is especially for ████ because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language (Japan).
SarahBrown	training	Gackt	I think █████ trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life.
SarahBrown	training	P.T.	This movie is one among the very few Indian movies, that would never fade away with the passage of time, nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish, even as the Indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the ████ styled film songs.
SarahBrown	training	Josef Werching	The cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of ██████████████ that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety.
SarahBrown	training	Kamal Amrohi	████████████ shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of Indian Cinema's history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	One particular trivia-bit stands out for me - ████ has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE.
SarahBrown	training	David Peoples	Maybe script writer █████████████ was nostalgic?
SarahBrown	training	Adam Jones	██████████ has a brilliant sense of humor.
SarahBrown	training	Cross Eyed	██████████ was beautifully shot.
SarahBrown	training	Cross Eyed	 ██████████ gives hope to every low budget film out there.
SarahBrown	training	Vidor	Director █████ is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy (at least for 1928) cameo as himself.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	"█████████████ plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger ""drama"" studio."
SarahBrown	training	Orson Welles'	After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of █████████████ classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	The only reason I even found out about this DVD was because ████████████████ is a favorite actor of mine.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	The film follows ████, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Russell	Second, I'm a ████████████ fan.
SarahBrown	training	John Carpenter	The Barefoot Executive and his ██████████████ films.
SarahBrown	training	Todd	Soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant ████ is an essential action hero.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt	It's not an award winning role, but ████ musters up convincing emotion with VERY little dialog.
SarahBrown	training	Betsy	In a coonskin cap and carrying Ol' █████, he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie.
SarahBrown	training	Jim Bowie	We learn that █████████ was, in the person of Santa Ana, fighting his own brother-in-law.
SarahBrown	training	Bowie	█████ wryly explains.
SarahBrown	training	Carlos Saura	I have seen other ████████████ movies and I agree that this film may be his best production.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Eustache	"In what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual ""revolution"" (purposefully I use quotations for that word), █████████████ wrote and directed The Mother and the Whore as a poetic, damning critique of those who can't seem to get enough love."
SarahBrown	training	this Ben-Hur	and I'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else ████████████ length feature has to offer- it's that in order to love, honestly, there has to be some level of happiness, of real truth.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	At first we think it might be all about what will happen to █████████, but we're mistaken.
SarahBrown	training	Whore	 The Mother and the █████'s strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity, the lack of monogamy, while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you've ever seen in a movie.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	At the same time we see a character like █████████, who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past, Eustache makes it so that the film itself isn't pretentious- though it could appear to be-
SarahBrown	training	Eustache	But as ████████ revels in the dialogs these characters have, sometimes trivial, or 'deep', or sexual, or frank, or occasionally extremely (or in a subdued manner) emotional, it's never, ever uninteresting or boring.
SarahBrown	training	Jim Jarmusch	This is probably the biggest influence on ████████████, who dedicated his film Broken Flowers to Eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely (and lovingly) in approach from the late Parisian.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Bauer	"████████████,the most recognizable face on screen here,leads a cast of top notch actors,in a story of ""can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd?""."
SarahBrown	training	Evelyn	A blonde little girl (Kitty) and a brunette one (██████).
SarahBrown	training	Evelyn	██████ steals Kitty's doll.
SarahBrown	training	Evelyn	Kitty pursues ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Evelyn	Suddenly ██████ grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs Kitty's doll and then cuts her (the doll's) head.
SarahBrown	training	Evelyn	And ██████ almost uses the dagger against Kitty.
SarahBrown	training	Sybil Danning	There's a nude by █████████████ lying on a sofa that's something to dream about.
SarahBrown	training	dalla Tomba	"If you've liked ""La Dama Rossa..."" check out also ""La Notte che Evelyn uscì ███████████""."
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	███████████████ does a good job, as do all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic film which was surprising.
SarahBrown	training	Becky Sharp	"To correct a previous poster the first Technicolor feature (after Disney's 5-year exclusivity deal) was 1935's ""███████████"" which was a costume drama that used the color for it's garish color costumes."
SarahBrown	training	Miike	The Great Yokai War is █████'s attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well.
SarahBrown	training	Quato	This brief moment of mundanity is sharply broken as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is (it is quite possible that the sheer hideousness of the creature is some bizarre █████ homage).
SarahBrown	training	Miyazaki	This really is a Miyazaki movie made into a live action movie, albeit a much seedier and more vicious than usual ████████ movie.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	There are elements which make you question whether █████ should have directed such a movie.
SarahBrown	training	Kato	There is also limb severing, in one case a severed hand twitches in front of the camera dripping with blood, a fair amount of sexual energy (Agi wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with ████ as motivation, while the Princess of the Rivers wears next to nothing and gets her thighs groped by the young hero in several scenes), and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this technicolour wonder was seemingly designed for.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	At the end of the day The Great Yokai War is easily on of █████'s stronger recent films.
SarahBrown	training	Gozu	While it lacks some of the perverse charm of say ████ or Ichi it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	In fact this is easily █████'s most deranged movie in that he embraces the sheer magic of the subject so wholeheartedly.
SarahBrown	training	Kiera Knightley	Parminder Nagra and ███████████████ were good and so was Archie Punjabi.
SarahBrown	training	Jonathon Rheyes Meyers	██████████████████████ was great at playing the coach.
SarahBrown	training	Ida Galli	When a man dies in a plane crash his wife (█████████) collects a $1 million life insurance policy.
SarahBrown	training	George Hilton	There are plenty of suspects, including a tenacious investigator (█████████████) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover.
SarahBrown	training	Martino	Director ███████ keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer.
SarahBrown	training	Anita Strindberg	"████████████████ (also memorable in ""Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key"" and ""Who Saw Her Die?"") is a stunning-looking heroine."
SarahBrown	training	Martino	It's one of ███████'s best films.
SarahBrown	training	Martin Scorsese	An enthralling, wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Martin Scorsese	Required viewing if you admire ███████████████ and his work.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Simon	This makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film, perhaps the best ██████████ ever wrote.
SarahBrown	training	Willy	█████ clearly has been living there too long.
SarahBrown	training	Willy	█████ wakes up and picks up the phone.
SarahBrown	training	Willy	"The amazing thing about ""The Sunshine Boys"" is how much it rubs your noses in █████'s almost existential condition without turning you off at all."
SarahBrown	training	Willy	"""89 years old and just like that, he dies of nothing'"" █████ says of one old songwriting friend, before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed ""lady"" with ""baby""."
SarahBrown	training	Lewis	His lines kill you, too, especially when he's trying to kill █████, for whom the TV reunion turns out to be a bad idea.
SarahBrown	training	Lewis	"""If this room was on fire you wouldn't be hot,"" █████ replies."
SarahBrown	training	Herbert Ross	Director ████████████ shoots everything in a very casual and understated way, with low lighting and mid-range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance.
SarahBrown	training	Ross	"You never get the feeling you are watching a movie, one of ""The Sunshine Boys"" many charms, and ████'s direction, like the acting of the three principals, goes a long way toward achieving that end."
SarahBrown	training	Jim Dale	The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lee Pace	████████ (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift.
SarahBrown	training	Chi McBride	"He teams with ███████████ (""Boston Public,"" Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent."
SarahBrown	training	Anna Friel	Everything is fine and funny until he comes across a childhood love, ██████████ (Goal!
SarahBrown	training	Phillip	I can really identify with Busy ███████'s character, and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me.
SarahBrown	training	Mother Night	These days, I doubt an intelligent novel like ████████████ would ever get the green light from the big Hollywood grindhouses.
SarahBrown	training	Mother Night	████████████ has tight direction and a solid cast.
SarahBrown	training	Nick Nolte	"██████████ who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older, still has that ""everyman"" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters."
SarahBrown	training	Sheryl Lee	██████████ is beautiful and great as always.
SarahBrown	training	Clutter	The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the ███████ family, but the point is made.
SarahBrown	training	Hickok	The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of ██████ and Smith.
SarahBrown	training	Perry Smith	███████████, whose early life was filled with security and love, but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path.
SarahBrown	training	Hickok	██████, poor and left pretty much to his own devices, not able to see how he fit in, using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with.
SarahBrown	training	Hickok	When caught, ██████ finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks.
SarahBrown	training	Hickok	Smith, who believes he deserves such a fate anyway, who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done, willingly tells the story when he learns that ██████ has cowardly caved in.
SarahBrown	training	Hickok	██████ blinked first.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaimans Stardust	This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw █████████████████████ and all I can say is Wow.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman's	and it is all █████████████ fault.
SarahBrown	training	Shrek	The pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be Laugh our Loud funny, Intelligent enough to make the first █████ look like an 80's Sitcom, and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	Once again ███████████ has done it, he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it.
SarahBrown	training	Neil	In the end I'm sure that ████'s writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it is easily one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it.
SarahBrown	training	Burton	" From the start, ██████ is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and ""dream time"" evaporates."
SarahBrown	training	Burton	Water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to ██████'s discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps.
SarahBrown	training	Burton	As ██████'s investigation continues, his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murder.
SarahBrown	training	Burton	"██████, becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel, says to his stepfather priest, ""Why didn't you tell me there were mysteries?"""
SarahBrown	training	Burton	██████ knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Shepard	Directed by ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	"A well formulated story and film all together, ███████ has never been better in a film role outside of his ""Bond"" movies."
SarahBrown	training	Davis	"█████ in one of her best roles since ""American Splendor"" gives another charming and witty performance."
SarahBrown	training	Doris	(yes █████, animals were hurt during filming)
SarahBrown	training	Jack Nicholson	I think the ending was copied by ██████████████ in the Shining?
SarahBrown	training	Blackboard Jungle	This should be in the same class as High Noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like █████████████████ or Rebel Without A Cause was for 50's youth.
SarahBrown	training	Chan	"""Dragonlord"" sees ████ returning to his role of ""Dragon"" from ""The Young Master""."
SarahBrown	training	Dragon	" Originally titled ""Young Master In Love"", this film sees ██████ (for the first sixty minutes at least) pursuing a villager girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways."
SarahBrown	training	Chan Stunt	"His rival for her affection is his friend (inappropriately named ""Cowboy"") played comically by the longtime ██████████-team member Mars."
SarahBrown	training	Chan	It seems quite unfocused, sometimes rushed, and I think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as ████'s other work from this period.
SarahBrown	training	Chan	"And again, ████ goes up against the same rival from ""The Young Master"" (is it the same character?), and the timing and energy here is brilliant."
SarahBrown	training	Chan	████'s style of using every last bit of his environment to help defeat his opponent - not just relying on pure physical ability - is as apparent here as anywhere else.
SarahBrown	training	Chan	This is an absolute highlight of the film and one of ████'s incredible career.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth	███████ plays the role of Hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears.
SarahBrown	training	Kate Winslet's	██████████████ performance is also of great note.
SarahBrown	training	Denzel Washington	Knowing what to expect (on the whole) from a █████████████████ performance - quality, integrity, gravitas, wry humour - will prepare you for what to expect from his directorial debut.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone	Be thankful Washington is too old to play ███████ because if he had we would firstly be deprived of the wonderfully measured and intelligently nuanced performance he gives as the Navy councellor.
SarahBrown	training	Derek Luke	However more importantly we wouldn't get to see the superb, we can only hope star making, turn from ██████████ in the title role.
SarahBrown	training	Bryant	While the part could have been a forgettable support or a standard 'girlfriend' role ██████ imbues it with life.
SarahBrown	training	Bryant	Tender and intelligent the role transcends stereotyping with ██████ inhabiting it, and she makes the part significant and interesting.
SarahBrown	training	Bryant	It doesn't hurt either that ██████ is possibly the most attractive woman you'll see on celluloid this year - the smile alone could thaw the coldest heart.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	██████████████ may not blow you away if you like big, explosive, plotless Hollywood films but for those who appreciate a finely crafted character piece, with excellent performances and steady well handled direction, this is for you.
SarahBrown	training	Park Chan-Wook	██████████████ throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of.
SarahBrown	training	Park	Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective ████ seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Red Buttons received an █████ for his touching performance of another GI who falls in love in Japan (though the Japanese women who plays opposite him also did a remarkable job).
SarahBrown	training	William Shakespeare's	"This is the only film of ""Hamlet"" that contains the full four hours of █████████████████████ masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story."
SarahBrown	training	William Shakespeares	All of these part of ████████████████████ greatest triumph.
SarahBrown	training	Bugs Bunny's	When the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over ████████████ home, Bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Russell	What really surprised me was that ████████████ did such a great job with an extremely limited role.
SarahBrown	training	Jason Isaacs	As usual, ████████████ insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered.
SarahBrown	training	Connie Nielsen	██████████████ was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous.
SarahBrown	training	Gary Busey's	Unfortunately, ████████████ role was too small and limited.
SarahBrown	training	Russell	The sort of feeb who thinks that ███████ didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point.
SarahBrown	training	Dee Dee	███████ is a wonderful singer, she has a great voice.
SarahBrown	training	Moe	███ is a great dancer.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Taylor	"More disappointingly, it's still M.I.A. on DVD  even from Warners' recently-announced ""Western Classics Collection"" Box Set (which does include 3 other █████████████ genre efforts); maybe, they're saving it for an eventual ""Signature Collection"" devoted to this stalwart of MGM, which may be coming next year in time for the 40th anniversary of his passing  I say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish Westerner with a fanatical hatred of Indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes; an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from 60,000,000 to 3,000 in the space of just 30 years!"
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Mann's	As expected, the company's relationship is a shaky one  reminiscent of that at the centre of ██████████████ THE NAKED SPUR (1953), another bleak open-air MGM Western.
SarahBrown	training	Milton Lott	 Incidentally, my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this (by ███████████) from the time of the film's original release: actually, he has collected a vast number of such editions  it is, after all, a practice still in vogue  where a book is re-issued to promote its cinematic adaptation.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Bogdanovich	A charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (█████████████████ is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club).
SarahBrown	training	Lugosi	The scene with the gargoyles outside of ██████'s room is a perfect example of the mood.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lucille Ball	"(I believe that ████████████ may have modeled her later career on Davies' style, that could be termed ""zany beauty"".)"
SarahBrown	training	David Lynch's	Some of the good things are the analyzes of Kieslowski's Blue, most of █████████████, some of Hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more I missed (I just remembered...Dogville), and I usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air.
SarahBrown	training	Shefali Shetty	The supporting role of ██████████████ who played the role of Sumitra Thakur was magnificent.
SarahBrown	training	Priyanka Chopra	███████████████ was good in her small role she had in the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Jaco van Dormael	████████████████ has not achieved simply a masterpiece, that would have been too simplistic; he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling.
SarahBrown	training	Georges	The cuasi-surrealist scenes fit in perfectly: ███████ recalls (or invents) past scenes of his life while either day-dreaming or sleeping; even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct.
SarahBrown	training	Chapeau	Magnifique! ███████!
SarahBrown	training	Stargate SG-1	But, and this is where I really think █████████████ deserves all the credit it can get, for each and every episode or stolen idea I think you can count at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour TV episode.
SarahBrown	training	Jodie Foster's	As I am exactly ██████████████ age, I related to this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Donna Summer	"""More Than a Feeling"" by Boston and sad numbers like ""On the Radio"" by ████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Shemp	It is not only one of the best Stooges films with █████, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced.
SarahBrown	training	Shemp	 █████ is particularly funny in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Moe	Other funny scenes: the close-up of ███'s mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.
SarahBrown	training	Duke York	Nikko the goon (played by █████████) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film.
SarahBrown	training	Shemp	"""Who Done It?"" is a gem among the Stooges films with █████."
SarahBrown	training	Brad Pitt	█████████ is simply superb as the errant son who rebels.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	██████████████ creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s.
SarahBrown	training	Cloris Leachman	And of course ███████████████ (also in this film) in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years..
SarahBrown	training	katja riemann	the German actress █████████████ completely deserved her award.
SarahBrown	training	riemann dvds	great luck for me that i am a native German speaking =) and only for a year in the us, so as soon as i am back i'll buy some ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	I liked █████ in this movie better than any movie he has ever done.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	It isn't an █████ caliber film of course, but, at least for me, this film has left a lasting impression since I first saw it back in 1984 (in the theatre).
SarahBrown	training	Mardi Gras	Astutely following ██████████ beads from China to the Carnival, the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting, compelling footage from both cultures.
SarahBrown	training	Mardi Gras	One of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and ██████████ revelers to each other through pictures.
SarahBrown	training	Fawlty Towers	We are all sorry for its loss: however, like █████████████, we will be able to revere this as a limited-length series of uniformly high quality.
SarahBrown	training	Stan Evans	We want more funny writings by the best writer ever ██████████..
SarahBrown	training	Saint	The patron █████ of the mindless masses...
SarahBrown	training	Anna Nicole	███████████ loved him , but he was not a $$$$Billionaire so he left him for a Billionaire.
SarahBrown	training	Stephen Spielberg	Maybe with █████████████████, or perhaps many other talented producers.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Jackson	███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Stan Evans	We want to view a lot more of and by ██████████ in the movies and on TV.
SarahBrown	training	Elvis	█████ has left the building!!!!!
SarahBrown	training	Joan	Young rich ████ and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies - and now they have to work for a living!
SarahBrown	training	Clark Gable	By wild co-incidences their careers meet head on, thanks to gangster ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Joan	In the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for ████ to do a couple of risque dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam-shovel).
SarahBrown	training	Joan	████ looks great, and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity (thank God she stopped the dancing!).
SarahBrown	training	Gable	█████ is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he wasn't a star yet and so didn't have to be the hero.
SarahBrown	training	William Bakewell	And ████████████████ is excellent as the poor confused brother.
SarahBrown	training	Harry Beaumont	And there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director ██████████████, who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience!
SarahBrown	training	Tim Burton	The cinematography, the narration, the music, the external sets all scream ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Zooey	Every time I see her on the screen I see █████.
SarahBrown	training	Anna Friel	Don't get me wrong, ██████████ does a great job.
SarahBrown	training	Zooey Deschanel	"It's more of a distraction that I keep thinking ""Why didn't they get ███████████████""."
SarahBrown	training	Lee Pace	████████ does a great job too.
SarahBrown	training	another Brian Fuller	If you enjoy Pushing Daisies you MUST go rent Wonderfalls, which is ████████████████████ creation.hmmmm
SarahBrown	training	Michael Bay	I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything ███████████ has came up with.
SarahBrown	training	Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx	Story: ████████████████████████) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson).
SarahBrown	training	Alvin	█████'s every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident.
SarahBrown	training	Alvin	█████ is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on.
SarahBrown	training	Doug Hutchinson	███████████████ is okay as Bristol.
SarahBrown	training	John Malkovitchesque	He can be over-the-top sometimes in his ████████████████████ demeanor.
SarahBrown	training	Looney Bin Jim	He was better here than he was as ██████████████ in Punisher: War Zone.
SarahBrown	training	David Morse	███████████ is good as the hard edged treasury agent.
SarahBrown	training	Jamie	Both him and █████ had some funny moments on screen.
SarahBrown	training	Quentin Tarantino	I'm pretty sure you've seen the Die Hard series and EVERY movie by █████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Taylor	This is the most compelling and excellent performance that █████████████ ever gave.
SarahBrown	training	Granger	███████ is kind of sad to watch, so fed up with the hunt, longing to go away with the girl and her baby.
SarahBrown	training	Lloyd Nolan	███████████ as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing.
SarahBrown	training	Russ Tamblyn	████████████ plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world.
SarahBrown	training	Taylor	It is ██████'s film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era.
SarahBrown	training	Blanding	Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just been short of space,will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled Mr. ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Myrna Loy	As well █████████ is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier Movie	"This is the definite ████████████████████, my favorite, I rank it higher than ""Breaking the waves"" or the latest ""Dancer in the Dark""..."
SarahBrown	training	Rusty	The life of █████ changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style, missing the love of █████ and her old friends.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent ██████████ festival and they loved 'Cover Girl', therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations.
SarahBrown	training	Modelos	Title (Brazil): '███████' ('Models')
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	Just what has ███████ tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves?
SarahBrown	training	Norman	As the movie opens, ██████ is an old man, flyfishing beside a rushing river, trying to understand the course his own life has taken.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	He and his younger brother ████ were the sons of a Presbyterian minister and devoted mother.
SarahBrown	training	Norm	████ has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad.
SarahBrown	training	Norm	But when ████ returns from his six years at Dartmouth, things are very different.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	████ is at the top of his game.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	██████ is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life, even as his father grills him about what he intends to do.
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	But with all the beauty and contemplation, and even though the Macleans are truly a God-fearing, scripture-heeding household, how is it that Rev. ███████'s family is unraveling?
SarahBrown	training	Paul	████ is true perfection as he fishes the river, but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing, while his family doesn't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed.
SarahBrown	training	Dad	Mom, ███ and Brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help.
SarahBrown	training	Pauly	█████ just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	These are all questions ██████ will ponder his entire life.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	This is certainly God's country, and filming it won an █████.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	Director ██████████████ plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting, and it works well.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	You'll see ██████ made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest -- and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it, leading into the unknown.
SarahBrown	training	Constance Marie	Yes, it's over the top, yes it's a bit clichéd and yes, ███████████████ is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again!
SarahBrown	training	George Lopez	████████████ is funny.
SarahBrown	training	Benny	I do have to say that the one big, dark, bitter spot is █████.
SarahBrown	training	George	As a mother she has to be the worst out there and I am just shocked and surprised that ██████, as the character, would stand by such a deplorable person for so long.
SarahBrown	training	Benny	Even so anytime I get ticked off at seeing █████ I think to myself: seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the Bill Engvall Show.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	MGM were unsure of how to market █████ when she first arrived in Hollywood.
SarahBrown	training	Ricardo Cortez	She did not speak a word of English so she must have found it difficult to work, also ██████████████ did not make it very easy for her.
SarahBrown	training	Mack Swain	██████████ plays her father.
SarahBrown	training	Leonora	███████ decides to visit her old home, and I agree - why hasn't she helped her mother out.
SarahBrown	training	Garbo	█████ is so enchantingly beautiful, it is hard to believe that he could be happy with Remedios.
SarahBrown	training	Citizen Kane	A perfect blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made: ████████████, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind.
SarahBrown	training	Truman Capote's	One of the best true-crime movies ever made and very faithful to ███████████████ book which invented the true-crime novel genre.
SarahBrown	training	Wilson	Why ██████ didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me.
SarahBrown	training	Will Geer	█████████ has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real Clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Paraminder Nagra	████████████████ (a beautiful women!) plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff.
SarahBrown	training	Pinky	In contradiction with her sister █████, complete the opposite of Yasminda.
SarahBrown	training	Drew Barrymore	██████████████ is very funny and her leading man (sorry but can't remember his name) is equally as good.
SarahBrown	training	Adrienne Barbeau	The third problem was the casting of ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Rambo	The main point of her performance that didn't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost █████-like woman on a mission.
SarahBrown	training	Barbeau	This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Jungian	Even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the ███████ side of Nazi mysticism.
SarahBrown	training	Nicholas Brendan	I see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit fizzly in the second half; and ████████████████, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance.
SarahBrown	training	Adam Jones	I think ██████████ brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a good way.
SarahBrown	training	Jones	As a writer/director, █████ exhibits complete control over his characters who are both absurd and lovable.
SarahBrown	training	Edward D. Wood	This 1998 film was based on a script by the late ██████████████, a script that featured NO dialogue in the tradition of films such as THE THIEF.
SarahBrown	training	Billy Zane	The whole film is played at a hysterical fever-pitch, and ██████████ provides an amazing tour-de-force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is.
SarahBrown	training	Ed Wood	I have a feeling that, wherever he is in the afterlife, ███████ is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film.
SarahBrown	training	Wood	████'s probably also laughing that, just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life, the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Marc Barr	The cast is absolutely stellar with the too infrequently seen ██████████████ absolutely perfect in the title role.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Grant	█████████████ provides comic relief of the highest order.
SarahBrown	training	Joseph Smith	"This movie attempts to make some sense out of how ████████████ could turn his ""vision"" into a major world religion."
SarahBrown	training	Joseph Smith	It portrays the trial of ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Brigham Young	Within the course of that trial, █████████████ stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith.
SarahBrown	training	Young	Then Smith is assassinated, and █████ must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land.
SarahBrown	training	kvell	Oy I'm █████
SarahBrown	training	Jeri Ryan	Too bad they couldn't have picked █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Park	I like Ms. ████, the Korean(?)lady.
SarahBrown	training	Bakula	██████ needs to find his niche--In QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	11 █████ nominations and zero win!!!
SarahBrown	training	Alice Walker's	 Its an amazing book - but true to ██████████████ style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters - so I am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Spielberg	████████████████ thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of Africa outside of the Safaris -
SarahBrown	training	Jim Varney	Having ██████████ in a non-clown role was a wonderful touch too as played the semi-serious role of a carny very well.
SarahBrown	training	Jean-Pierre Léaud	you have a insecure, troubled and fascinating main character (played by █████████████████) who is trapped between two (no, three) women.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Eustache	yet director █████████████ manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty.
SarahBrown	training	Jean-Pierre Léaud	being such a long movie, one cannot but burst into laughing when, after 2 hours of speaking politely, █████████████████ all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie.
SarahBrown	training	Françoise Lebrun	nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of ████████████████ towards the end of the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Oldboy	"Besides the apparent connections with ""██████"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action."
SarahBrown	training	Stanley Kubrick	Park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to ███████████████; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.
SarahBrown	training	hostel--	The plot and the main setting--a student ████████ were excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Poirot	One significant point, many ██████ watchers don't recognize good acting or good characterization.
SarahBrown	training	Poirot	I also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the ██████ mysteries.
SarahBrown	training	Poirot	That said, the ██████ mysteries vary in quality, but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe.
SarahBrown	training	Poirot	With the singular exception of The Five Little Pigs which was fabulous in plot, character and theme, the longer ██████ films are neither that good or that bad.
SarahBrown	training	Poirot	For the record, I have seen all the longer ██████/Suchet films.
SarahBrown	training	Hastings	Finally, films without Lemon, ████████, and/or Japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence.
SarahBrown	training	Hastings	There presence, however, is either obtrusive (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant with ████████.
SarahBrown	training	David	As █████ pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize.
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Speilberg	All together the movie was well directed by ████████████████, and should not be passed up.
SarahBrown	training	Martin Luther King	But Sjoman does something interesting: the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes; it's impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative, documentary, film-within-a-film, and even a serious interview with ██████████████████, who also acts as a quasi-guru for Lena.
SarahBrown	training	Bergman	Where ███████ had it down to a T with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies, Sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors.
SarahBrown	training	W.R.	If it's not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as ████ or Last Tango, it's close behind.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	"But here █████, in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less, proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions, and with it boatload of CGI, creature-effects and make-up, and an epic battle that is more like a ""festival"" than something out of Lord of the Rings."
SarahBrown	training	Henson	Or, of course, to ██████'s films.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	And through all of these comparisons, and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments, it's █████ all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	Soon, things come to a head, in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories, but can only be contained, up to a point, by █████ and his crew.
SarahBrown	training	Sato	This has creatures galore, including a one-eyed umbrella stand, and a walking, talking wall, not to mention a turtle, a fire serpent, and a woman who became cursed by ████.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	 Yet through all of this, the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of █████'s career is here as well, which distinguishes it from its animated, Muppet and sci-fi counterparts.
SarahBrown	training	Akuzi	There's the bizarre humor as usual, including a song dedicated to █████ beans at a crucial moment in the climax, and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (I loved, for example, the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller, or the anxious turtle-Yokai).
SarahBrown	training	Miike	The biggest danger with █████'s access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry, which he flirts with, is overkill on this end.
SarahBrown	training	Tadashi	He's got everything down, I'm sure, with storyboards, and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions (one of them is when all is said and done, and ███████ and the 'other' human character are in the middle of the Tokyo rubble in an overhead shot), but the CGI is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots, and the interplay skirts on being TOO flamboyant, and some visuals, like the overlay of the Yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map, just seem weak and pat.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	I almost wondered if █████ might dip into (bad) Spy Kids territory, quite frankly.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Twisty plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades, and a bit of ████ all come together to make one heck of a piece of Italian exploitation.
SarahBrown	training	Martino	███████ definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Stewart	This is such a fantastic movie, a Western about a self-concerned man (█████████████) going up to the Klondike for gold.
SarahBrown	training	John McIntire	On the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska (█████████████, giving a wonderfully evil performance), whom he hassles back.
SarahBrown	training	McIntire	████████ threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the States.
SarahBrown	training	McIntire	The main chunk of the story is about the peaceful Klondike town of Dawson being turned upside down by new residents from ████████'s town.
SarahBrown	training	McIntire	She paves the way for ████████ and his goons to come up, too.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	███████ gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954, Rear Window).
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	Still, ███████ plays it so damn well, he makes this character very human.
SarahBrown	training	Corinne Calvet	In addition to those I've mentioned, the adorable French actress ██████████████ is very good.
SarahBrown	training	Walter Brennen	And I ought to single out ██████████████, as well.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	His relationship with ███████ is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man.
SarahBrown	training	Mann	The screenplay is very well written, and ████'s direction is impeccable.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Walken	Plus, the idea of ██████████████████ singing and dancing made me curious.
SarahBrown	training	Walken	I loved watching ██████ in this role thinking about what the future held for him.
SarahBrown	training	Walken	But while staying true to almost every aspect, ██████'s acting made it believable.
SarahBrown	training	Creator Bryan Fuller	"Then again, it's in ""Pushing Daisies time,"" according to ████████████████████, so it makes it plausible again."
SarahBrown	training	Chan-wook Park's	I'm the first to recognize that ████████████████ Thirst is exceptionally well made, but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time.
SarahBrown	training	Hyeon	Instead of legitimately dying, █████ becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).
SarahBrown	training	Hyeon	Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torturous death if exposed to █████ for a length of time.
SarahBrown	training	Hyeon	In doing so, █████ has created a monster.
SarahBrown	training	Kang	Tae-joo admits(..though a slip of the tongue)that, in fact, ████-woo never hurt her, and as she thirsts for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesn't bother her morally or psychologically.
SarahBrown	training	Hyeon	Innocent people die because of █████'s love(..what once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the end)for Tae-joo, and it will cease to end if he doesn't make a painful choice.
SarahBrown	training	Hyeon	"█████, seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening, accepts ""hell"" for Tae-joo so one could look at Thirst as a unique love story, but not exactly a healthy one."
SarahBrown	training	Jessica Tandy	█████████████ breaks the record as the oldest actress.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Benjamin	████████████████ was also fantastic in this.
SarahBrown	training	Wesley Jonathan	I would definitely say that it is great to see ███████████████ back on the screen because I really loved him in City Guy.
SarahBrown	training	Valerie	I had also seen the woman who plays ███████'s friend in Popular and while I think that was an okay show, I do not really like her character in this show because she's just not my cup of tea but she rounds it out pretty well
SarahBrown	training	Pendragon Pictures'	"███████████████████ new film ""H G Wells' War of the Worlds"", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years."
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	The DVD was rushed out to coincide with the release of █████████'s version, which hits theatres June 29.
SarahBrown	training	George Pal	But on the whole, this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Oscars	The acting and direction won't win any ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff Wayne	And to top it off, ██████████ is making an animated film of his best-selling album from 1978, but that won't be out until 2007.
SarahBrown	training	CASPER	I've often wondered just how much ██████ was meant for children...with all the issues revolving around his identity (in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, as his home is a cemetery plot), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film.
SarahBrown	training	Casper	Maybe ██████ was meant more as a morality play, or Famous Studios felt like breaking new ground in 'reality' cartoons.
SarahBrown	training	Norman Maclean's	"""A River Runs Through It"" is the perfect name for this film (and ████████████████ novel)."
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	██████████████ brings a lot to the film.
SarahBrown	training	Susan Sarandon	██████████████ is such a good actor, that she made an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing.
SarahBrown	training	Gary	When it was over, I had to rewind the film to once again watch the real ████ and all his shining idiocy.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt	████ manages to act without speaking, letting moments speak for themselves.
SarahBrown	training	Jesse	"There is not much more I can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one, except - as █████ says - ""it's the berries""."
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	Maybe ██████████████ did hold strict sway onto the actors/actresses during the filming of this movie, so that the beauty of the story would not get lost.
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	The church's pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the Rev. ███████ did in his church.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Skeritt	This is the third film I've seen in which ███████████ (?) plays a father, all different styles and brilliantly acted.
SarahBrown	training	Arnold	"I am thinking particularly of ""Crash"" and most of ""██████'s"" movies."
SarahBrown	training	Bronte	While the book is better than this,I am glad I have seen it and would reccomend it to people who have read the book,are fans of ██████ or like costume dramas(I
SarahBrown	training	Authur	and I promise, you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some ██████ lines in your head.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Mulligan	"Directed by ███████████████, famous for his superb work in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" the film never hits a false note."
SarahBrown	training	Liza Minnelli's	I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the passage of nearly 27 years it's still as enjoyable as it ever was ███████████████ role as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	██████ is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for for everyone
SarahBrown	training	Scott Bakula	████████████ played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before.
SarahBrown	training	Rihanna	It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella (███████ eat your heart out!)
SarahBrown	training	James Stewart	█████████████ here is again a man fighting within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money, and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered.
SarahBrown	training	Mann	████ is excellent directing the shootouts, but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	Like all of the Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of ███████'s character which is more complex.
SarahBrown	training	Briget Bardot	Had the director cast a █████████████ bombshell the effect would have been nullified.
SarahBrown	training	Sean Connery	As usual, ████████████ does a great job.
SarahBrown	training	Bryan Fuller	████████████, the creator, has an amazing creative mind.
SarahBrown	training	Brian Fuller	It's a mix of the marvelous worlds ████████████ created in previous TV shows, mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings, something that a fairytale always is.
SarahBrown	training	Tim Burton	"When I heard about ""Pushing Daisies"" for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar (or maybe some kind of tribute) to everything that ██████████ has created since ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" (1985) to ""Big Fish"" (2003) and ""Charlie And The Cholate Factory"" (2005)."
SarahBrown	training	Lee Pace	████████ is tender, soft and contained as the character asks for.
SarahBrown	training	Anna Friel	██████████ is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be.
SarahBrown	training	Kurtz	Swoozie █████ shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown, for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing.
SarahBrown	training	Bryan Fuller	"It's true that TV doesn't respect great TV shows as those ones ████████████ created - except ""Heroes"" that's still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones."
SarahBrown	training	Strangelove	In Dr. ███████████ you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Torrance	I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on █████████████ in the filmed version.
SarahBrown	training	Nicholson	The cues █████████ provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son.
SarahBrown	training	Terry Gilliam	Probably a bit much for normal American kids, and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film, this movie reminded me a quite a bit of Time Bandits - very █████████████ all the way through.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	And while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of █████'s work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn poignant.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	F'n rad, and one of █████'s best!
SarahBrown	training	Goldberg	Field, Kline, ████████, and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm.
SarahBrown	training	Moriarty	████████ is a stand-out in the showy villainess role, making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see!!
SarahBrown	training	Michael Hoffman	Director ███████████████ keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Harling's	Mention must also be made of ████████████████ screenplay, carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera.
SarahBrown	training	John Carpenter's	"Almost too well done... ""████████████████ Vampires"" was entertaining, a solid piece of popcorn-entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects."
SarahBrown	training	Jon Bon Jovi	"""Vampires: Los Muertos"" tries the same starting with a rock-star ████████████ playing one of the main characters, but does that almost too well...:"
SarahBrown	training	Jon Bon Jovi	"I haven't seen ████████████ in any other movie, so I am not able to compare his acting in ""Vampires: Los Muertos"" to his other roles, but I was really suprised of his good performance."
SarahBrown	training	Arly Jover	"The vampiress played by ██████████ is not the leather dressed killer-machine of a vampire-leader we met in Part 1 (or in similar way in ""Ghosts of Mars"")."
SarahBrown	training	Murnau	"But the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action-horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like ██████'s ""Nosferatu""."
SarahBrown	training	Tommy Lee Wallace	"Nevertheless █████████████████ did really a great job, ""Vampires:Los Muertos"" is surprisingly good."
SarahBrown	training	Wallace	But I also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie ███████ is sometimes almost too creative, too expressive.
SarahBrown	training	Bloody Mary	This wasn't as strong an episode as I'd hoped for, but Night of the Living Homeless was a stronger finisher then Stanley's Cup, Tsst, ███████████, or Erection Day.
SarahBrown	training	Goobacks	It still can't hold a candle to Woodland Critter Christmas and ████████, but few episodes can.
SarahBrown	training	Randy	█████ and other residents are locked in the Community Center, though this time on the roof, where they can survey the scene.
SarahBrown	training	Randy	A particularly funny moment is when one member finds out his home is gone, and becomes homeless, leaving █████ no choice but to shoot him.
SarahBrown	training	Morricone	If nothing else, will SOMEBODY please consider getting the soundtrack onto some kind of CD, whether it be a compilation with other █████████ music or as a stand-alone.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Horror movies aren't supposed to be ███████████, but I'm not gonna go there.
SarahBrown	training	Katherine Heigl	I really did wish to see much, much more of ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	I don't like to tell people which movies they should see, but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that I thought was really worth seeing, then █████████ would be it.
SarahBrown	training	Janice Meredith	In fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy, she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	 What you're seeing by all accounts in Show People is the real ██████, a gifted comedienne, a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person.
SarahBrown	training	Marion	██████ is eager young hopeful who arrives in Hollywood like so many others, looking for that big break.
SarahBrown	training	William Haines	And also wins the heart of young comic actor ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	It's easy to see why █████████████ liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite.
SarahBrown	training	Lucy Maud Montgomery's	██████████████████████ well-loved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie.
SarahBrown	training	Anne Shirley	Taking her professional name from the character she portrayed, actress ████████████ is a joy as the red-headed fourteen-year-old orphan who completely alters the lives of her new guardians.
SarahBrown	training	Sara Haden	██████████ is appropriately prickly as a nosy neighbor.
SarahBrown	training	Moonstruck	"It's one of those movies that could easily get by someone, but for romantic comedy ""██████████"" is really in a class by itself."
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	GBS wrote his own screen adaptation of this Nobel Prize winning play but didn't live to see it produced (he had won an █████ in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 play PYGMALION).
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	This movie was incredible on so many levels and I was disappointed that it didn't win an █████, I think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	I strongly recommend this film to everyone, you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Antwone Fisher	If you like inspirational true stories, then watch ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Thomas Kinkade	"Recently I was pondering a statement made by the artist ██████████████ in one of his inspirational books; He states: ""You and I were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic."
SarahBrown	training	Kinkade	"Nor do I think God had banal television programs, media hype, worthless purchases, and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe..."" I hadn't seen ""A river runs through it"" in a couple of years, but after pondering ███████'s statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye."
SarahBrown	training	Maurice Richard	A boy who adores ███████████████ of the Montreal Canadiens receives, much to his horror, a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the mail.
SarahBrown	training	Maurice Richard	I recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey, but nearly everyone knew about ███████████████ and the Toronto/Montreal rivalry.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	This is an almost action-less film following ████, an insomniac, as he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself off a building, and, for a lot of the time, can't tell reality from hallucination.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	Introduce a talking dog (another hallucination) and children that suddenly appear in ████'s bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there (more hallucination) and you have an interesting, mind boggling, 43 minutes
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	Sometimes it takes a film-making master like ███████ to bring that extra little something, that unique, untractable and elusive ingredient that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece, one for the ages.
SarahBrown	training	Stephen King's	It's not just that ██████████████ story has enough meat and potatoes making it difficult for even the most workmanlike of directors to miss.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	███████'s miss-en-scene is, as usually, terrific.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	There's a symmetry and geometrical approach in how ███████ perceives space that reminds me very much of how Japanese directors worked in the sixties.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	The first shot of ████'s typewriter, accompanied off screen from the thumps of a ball, like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the typewriter itself as though it is an instrument of doom all by itself, later on proving to be nothing short of just that.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	████ hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens instead of remaining static, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Nicholson's	Much has been said of ████████████████ obtrusive overacting.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Nicholson	His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Altman	Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for █████████████ in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of fragility and emotional distress.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	7 years on, I'm amazed that ████ is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is ███████'s best work.
SarahBrown	training	Strangelove	A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. ███████████, but if those film pioneered film making, then The Shining perfected it.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	"He explains to █████ that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication ""shining."""
SarahBrown	training	Danny	█████ asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	█████'s curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened.
SarahBrown	training	Danny	"█████ starts calling out the word ""redrum"" frantically, and scribbling it on walls."
SarahBrown	training	Tony	"He goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is ████, his own ""imaginary friend."""
SarahBrown	training	Jack	Horrified, ████ threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	████ picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Nicholson's	████████████████ performance is timeless and unforgettable.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	Also another incredible scene is when ████ sees a ghost woman in the bathtub, it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema.
SarahBrown	training	Lambert Hillyer	The plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before (even way back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director ███████████████ has created a very nifty little original horror film.
SarahBrown	training	Janos Rukh	The plot focuses on the good hearted Dr ██████████; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth.
SarahBrown	training	Karloff	The second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and ███████ gets a chance to shine (literally).
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Over the past two years I had been told numerous times that the ██████ movies were amazing, many a time I had to bite my tongue and not say what I really thought about the movies.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne Ultimatum	Until two months ago I couldn't have given a damn about the ████████████████, I really had no intentions of watching it.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Because of this I was first in line today to see the ██████ Ultimatum.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne Ultimatum	And boy did ████████████████ not disappoint!
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	However, it appears he was born to play ██████ (pardon the pun).
SarahBrown	training	Matt Damon	Throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes, in this movie we see ██████████ at his very best, even better than he was in The Departed and I thought he was one of the best things in The Departed.
SarahBrown	training	Matt Damon	██████████ plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable.
SarahBrown	training	Joan Allen	██████████ was one of my favourite things in Bourne Supremacy, here she excels herself.
SarahBrown	training	Julia Stiles	████████████ is a very underrated actress and I think she deserves a lot more roles, well decent roles, than she gets.
SarahBrown	training	Albert Finney	Special mention must also go to █████████████ who makes the most of his all too brief screen time, I will not say anything about the character, that's best left as a surprise, but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The ██████ movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences, this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences, good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Well the action in Ultimatum has to be the best of the ██████ series.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	In my eyes no, but if you are not a fan of the ██████ series or have not seen the previous two then I wouldn't recommend Ultimatum for you.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The ██████ Ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007.
SarahBrown	training	a James Bond	As ████████████ fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that Ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the Bond movies, and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	While ██████ as a whole might not be a better franchise than the Bond series, it is definitely nearly its equal.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark's	███████████ visual artistry is at its peek in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	But alas, █████████ hasn't improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialog are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys didn't help either).
SarahBrown	training	Vanessa Redgrave	████████████████ is great even while lying in bed.
SarahBrown	training	Claire Danes	████████████ continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth.
SarahBrown	training	Natasha Richardson	I agree with a previous comment: ██████████████████ definitely had some plastic job done to her face.
SarahBrown	training	Toni Collette	Both she and █████████████ sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters.
SarahBrown	training	Toni Collette	█████████████ additionally is way too old for her character.
SarahBrown	training	Streep	██████'s performance actually is little more than a cameo.
SarahBrown	training	Hugh Dancy	As for the men; ██████████ enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed.
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Wilson	██████████████ on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Cacoyannis	██████████████████ has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name, including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire The Day the Fish Came Out.
SarahBrown	training	Euripides	Adapted by Cacoyannis from the play by █████████, it's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the United States courtesy the Flix Channel.
SarahBrown	training	Kazakos	███████ and Papas are both outstanding, but it is the stunning Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen, blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game.
SarahBrown	training	Frank Morgan	Loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager, played wonderfully by ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	This makes the timid romance between ███████ and Sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	Bend it like ███████ is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line.
SarahBrown	training	Jess	It is about a girl called ████ who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	Bend it like ███████ great flick
SarahBrown	training	Dan Katzir	with very little screen time and money, ██████████ manages to do so much.
SarahBrown	training	Ishai Setton	This is the first feature-length project from ████████████ and I found myself wishing that It had been my project.
SarahBrown	training	Paget Brewster	██████████████ delivers a very believable and likable performance.
SarahBrown	training	Firefly	I haven't enjoyed anything as much since ███████ (also and amazing show).
SarahBrown	training	Max	As proof of my obsessiveness, ███'s barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice.
SarahBrown	training	Mitchell Leisen	I am quite the ███████████████ fan so it was a great anticipation that I rented this movie but the print I got was extremely bad, so worn down from use and scorched seemingly beyond repair, the movie was so dark.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony	It starts with a few laughs and poor ███████ in a one scene role where he speaks not a word of English gets slapped around by Freddie.
SarahBrown	training	Cecil Cunningham	The scenes are so well acted by Lombard and ████████████████, the movie gains a pulse.
SarahBrown	training	Dorothy Lamour	Then the temptress arrives in the form of ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Freddie	And Lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half, a bit more is called of ███████ and he fails to deliver the goods.
SarahBrown	training	Goro	However, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and ████'s fantastic hair/bad English, you're in for a real treat.
SarahBrown	training	Goro	And even then, the latter should be a bit careful, because ████'s Japanese fans were a bit upset about it, they thought he was selling himself out.
SarahBrown	training	Johnny Kitagawa	(He wasn't really, not when ███████████████ (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).
SarahBrown	training	Drake	Rukh's young trophy wife (█████), who falls head over heels for that scrap of a human being.
SarahBrown	training	RIP Peter	█████████.
SarahBrown	training	Clint Tollinger	███████████████ arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter, tho he finds her, the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim.
SarahBrown	training	Tollinger	Whilst here, the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of █████████'s reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Wilson	Directed and co-written by first time director ██████████████, Man With The Gun holds few surprises for the genre, but it's dark in tone, violent and above all else, highly watchable.
SarahBrown	training	Roy	I am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as I know how they felt as my father died when I was 13 years too just like ███.
SarahBrown	training	Anita Strindberg	The beautiful ████████████████, who will be remembered from Your Vice is a Locked Room, stars alongside Hilton and excellently provides the classic Giallo female lead.
SarahBrown	training	Sergio Martino	██████████████ does a good job in the director's chair once again, with several beautiful scenes - the best of which taking place in a room bathed with green lighting!
SarahBrown	training	Sergio Martino	The Case of the Scorpion's Tail is a quality Giallo film, and yet another success for the great ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	"He dismisses █████'s interpretations because they don't seem ""in line"" with what the director originally intended."
SarahBrown	training	Zizek	Because of this, whoever wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort on insulting █████.
SarahBrown	training	Kristevian	If you are at all interested in Freudian, Laconian, or ██████████ discourse, this movie is a must.
SarahBrown	training	Tess	████ is definitely a gifted filmmaker.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic	███████ shined in his role that she perfectly crafted.
SarahBrown	training	Tess	With all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill, ████ shows that it's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors.
SarahBrown	training	Amitabh Bacchan	This movie will tell you why ███████████████ is a one man industry.
SarahBrown	training	Prakash	███████ has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it.
SarahBrown	training	Zanzeer	███████ saw the making of Angry Young Man.
SarahBrown	training	Lawaris	███████ was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was about the master-servant loyalties.
SarahBrown	training	Haryanavi	What comprised of the movie is a caricature of a █████████ who goes to Mumbai and turns into a regulation hero.
SarahBrown	training	Amitabh	███████'s vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks, thanks to his flawless stock Haryanvi accent.
SarahBrown	training	Amitabh	███████, by now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies.
SarahBrown	training	Manmohan Desai	Thanks to ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Amitabh	His was the all important role of the master while ███████ was his loyal servant.
SarahBrown	training	Amitabh	And as long as it stayed that way, the people came and saw ███████ wearing a new hat and went back home happy.
SarahBrown	training	Amitabh Bacchan	███████████████ as the Haryanvi.
SarahBrown	training	Prakash Mehra	█████████████ created yet another icon in the name of a story.
SarahBrown	training	Chuck	█████ the story, the characters and the plot.
SarahBrown	training	Amitabh	My marks are for ███████ alone.
SarahBrown	training	Marvin Gaye's	"For instance, we've all seen sperm finding its way to the egg, but have you ever seen it set to the tune of █████████████ ""Let's Get It On""?"
SarahBrown	training	Steve Gordon	Written and directed by ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	John Gielgud	It won Sir ████████████ the Academy Award.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur Bach	███████████ is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk, but you can't help but like him.
SarahBrown	training	Moore	█████ lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	██████ is one of those movies that doesn't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional: it just comes naturally.
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	Why should you see ██████?
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	At a period in which films are becoming more and more serious, ██████ reminds us what it feels like to go to the movies and just have a good time.
SarahBrown	training	Hitler	While Rome goes mad celebrating ██████'s visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two outsiders stay home, in a large building, and wind up meeting.
SarahBrown	training	Sofia Loren	She is ███████████, who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children.
SarahBrown	training	Sofia Loren	Mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and ███████████ does a superb job, very far away from her usual truck driver's pin-up, Neapolitan fishwife personas.
SarahBrown	training	John McKay	Mostly known for directing ██████████ wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty-something friends in a small town in England.
SarahBrown	training	Andie MacDowell	███████████████ once again thrown by the surrounds of the British (which is where I find she exudes the most) is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man.
SarahBrown	training	Mel Brooks-	"and the movies based on the series, the humor relies on ███████████style spot gags and silly comments (namely the ""yes it is"" remarks), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him."
SarahBrown	training	Leslie Nielsen	You can't go wrong with ██████████████ in these sorts of roles.
SarahBrown	training	Preston Waters	██████████████ is off to a bad summer.
SarahBrown	training	Quigley	███████'s just come from the bank too from giving the owner $1,000,000 to give to this guy tomorrow.
SarahBrown	training	Quigley	███████ starts to write a check for the damage, but only succeeds in writing his name before a police car circles the area.
SarahBrown	training	Preston	Afraid, he gives ███████ the check, informs him to give it to his dad to finish out.
SarahBrown	training	Preston	That evening though, ███████ tells his dad that he doesn't want a new bike, he wants his own room back, better yet his own house.
SarahBrown	training	Preston	Moping in his room ███████ figures things can't get any worse he realizes that he forgot about the check as it's still in his shirt pocket.
SarahBrown	training	Preston	Now the three have to track ███████ down.
SarahBrown	training	Preston	Meanwhile, ███████ has fun buying all sorts of stuff including his own house and even going on dates with a disguised bank lady who's really and FBI agent (who's trying to track the 3 bad guys down).
SarahBrown	training	Macintosh	He makes this person up named Mr. █████████ who he works for and even plans a party for him on his birthday.
SarahBrown	training	Miguel Ferrer	█████████████ plays his role very good.
SarahBrown	training	Rick Ducommun	█████████████ (the stressed out boss from Ghost in the Machine) plays a wonderful friendly chauffeur in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie	█████ made two stand up comedy films.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy's	Any fan of stand-up comedy films should see ██████████████ Delirious.
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	████████████ really shines in his roll.
SarahBrown	training	xica da Silva	█████████████ is one of the best Brazilians opera soap ever!
SarahBrown	training	Xica da Silva	█████████████ does with that you don't want to lose a I only surrender, from beginning to end!
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	When it comes down to fairy tales, ██████████ was the one that made you cry the most.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	poor ██████████ is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	Before the story begins, ██████████ and her father are lonely, and rich beyond their needs.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	the stepmother, only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter, ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	So for many days, ██████████ is a slave to her step-mother and her step-sisters.
SarahBrown	training	Cinderella	she has hope however, thanks to her friends, the mice of the home (sounds like ██████████ wasn't playing with a full deck.)
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that ████████ poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Laurence Fishburne	As an old white housewife I can still appreciate that ██████████████████ is one of our finest actors.
SarahBrown	training	Fishburne	It is Mr. █████████'s usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships.
SarahBrown	training	Tadashi	The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played ███████'s tormentors were not up to the job.
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	"Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ████ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect ""The Empire Strikes Back""."
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	Did ████████████ place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities?
SarahBrown	training	Luke	Now swathed all in black, ████'s discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	█████' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.
SarahBrown	training	Tatooine	The battle scene on ████████ is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga.
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with ███████████ and his fate.
SarahBrown	training	Leia	In fact only ████'s character is developed in ROTJ, Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.
SarahBrown	training	Skywalker	The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful █████████ to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?)
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ian McDiarmid	Played brilliantly by █████████████, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.
SarahBrown	training	John Williams'	"Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ██████████████ score is as much a part of ""Star Wars"" folklore as light sabers and the Force."
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	█████ left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made.
SarahBrown	training	Ann Lord	████████ is elderly, bed-ridden and spending her last few days on Earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side.
SarahBrown	training	Ann	"Both ███ and her two daughters - one married with children, one a serial ""commitophobe"" - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists, and perhaps more importantly, if true love can endure the test of time."
SarahBrown	training	Ann	The subtle fact that the aged ███ is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters.
SarahBrown	training	Ann	The cinematography for Evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in ███'s mind as she recalls the past, and for that reason I think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed, to give everyone an ethereal glow (and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real, but occurred in the past).
SarahBrown	training	Claire Danes	"████████████ is beautiful (appearing to be really, really tall, though just 5' 5"" in reality), and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test."
SarahBrown	training	Hugh Dancy's	I can't really say anything negative about this film at all, though ████████████ struggle to have his character emerge from utter one-dimensionality is in the end a total loss.
SarahBrown	training	Rambo	Catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of Die Hard 4 or the upcoming █████ flick.
SarahBrown	training	Leslie Nielsen	██████████████ is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You ain't seen nothing yet.
SarahBrown	training	Creep	In a lot of ways, the British Film Industry is really becoming one on it's own, especially in the horror thriller department, with films such as █████ and the successful 28 Days Later (which this has strong echoes of in parts.)
SarahBrown	training	Eddie Murphy	████████████ really made me laugh my ass off on this HBO stand up comedy show.
SarahBrown	training	Goony Goo Goo	The Ice Cream Man,█████████████,is also funny.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of ██████████████ he was only able to do comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Lion King II	████████████:
SarahBrown	training	Simba	█████'s Pride is the BY FAR the best direct-to-video sequel that Disney, or any other studio, has made for an animated feature.
SarahBrown	training	Elton John	It has the original cast, songs by ██████████, a hilarious story, exciting action, and touching character moments.
SarahBrown	training	Pumbaa	Not so much a new story, but filler and extended background on Timon and ██████, and their place in this story.
SarahBrown	training	Lion King	So if you love █████████, you need this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Human Kimberly	There should be more episodes made about ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Human Kimberly's	The episode about the cats disguising themselves as pre-teen girls to gain admittance to ████████████████ slumber party in order to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a hilarious classic.
SarahBrown	training	Andie	Beauty is all around, in actors' play (█████ is superb as always), in well designed shots, and in authors' red line idea - the Love.
SarahBrown	training	Kenny	I think the █████'s character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life.
SarahBrown	training	Andie	His interaction makes █████'s character living as entertaining as it could possibly be.
SarahBrown	training	Andie	The fact that █████ successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad, instead it shows that life prevails in any forms, even in this small British village, which is shown perfectly.
SarahBrown	training	Andie	And █████ again is doing superb job!
SarahBrown	training	Charlie B. Barkin	The dog star,█████████████████, is murdered by his formal business partner, Carface, (who is absolutely diabolical by the way).
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	His soul then goes to where else but Heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his life's time, which ███████, being the sneaky but lovable cad that he is steals and rewinds, sending him back to Earth.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	Once back on Earth, ███████ goes about seeking revenge on the evil Carface.
SarahBrown	training	Toth	A classic series that should be at least repeated or released on DVD.Billy ████,after realising he is adopted after the death of his parents,embarks on a journey to find his real parents.
SarahBrown	training	Billys	After various rites of passage,his search culminates in the discovery that his fathers identity was stolen and used by a human trafficker in Europe!If i remember correctly,the series ends on the Austrian(?] ski slopes and a cliff top chase resulting in the death of ██████ fathers betrayer.
SarahBrown	training	Billy	The main arc was often eclipsed by the slices of life that █████ went through during his years of toiling to find his mother and fathers secrets.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"I finally watched the third film in █████'s trilogy: ""Fire""."
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	 █████ is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	Worse, if someone like █████ has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire).
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	In any case █████'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack.
SarahBrown	training	Superb	██████, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	There was (get this) character development (and ███████ is the epitome of the dynamic character), plot development, superb animation, emotional involvement, and a rational, relatable, and consistent theme.
SarahBrown	training	Futurama	"I'd be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie, and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across (ala ""Jurassic Bark"", for those of you who are '████████' fans), and this is what makes this movie so good."
SarahBrown	training	Fleischer	"PERHAPS in an attempt to find another ""Hot Property"" for adaptation, the Brothers █████████ thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the Newspaper Comic Strip with their production of 1933's POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer Studios/Paramount)."
SarahBrown	training	brawlin	AS is now common knowledge, the gruff, squinty eyed, ███████' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever; outlasting and literally outliving the Fleischers and their Studio, lasting to this day.
SarahBrown	training	HENRY	█████ was a most popular feature in the Hearst Papers' line-up; appearing as both a Daily and on Sunday's Color Comics Supplement, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY.
SarahBrown	training	Schultz	Remember that one, ███████?
SarahBrown	training	Betty	IN viewing the chubby, little, bald boy Comic Strip 'Hero' and his on screen antics, both solo and in tandem with Miss █████; we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled.
SarahBrown	training	the HENRY Feature	These mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page; as █████████████████ was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime'.
SarahBrown	training	Dave Fleischer's	THE FUNNIEST LIVING American (Fleischer Studios/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what is; basically being a one situational exercise; being punctuated with the usual array of ████████████████ rapid fire, machine gun-like gags.
SarahBrown	training	Henry	It is a sort of love at first sight as █████ attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had, to coins in his pocket.
SarahBrown	training	Boop	He is in formed by Miss ████ that it would be $2.00 in depression era money to make the purchase.
SarahBrown	training	Betty	BUT a reprieve is soon on the horizon as █████ asks the boy to mind the store, while she leaves on urgent business.
SarahBrown	training	Betty	In return for his services, Miss █████ promises him the little dog in return.
SarahBrown	training	Betty	Of course, they have a deal and █████ leaves.
SarahBrown	training	Henry	GETTING to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the Fleischer Crew to fire up a whole new string of gags; this time featuring bird seed, █████'s bald pate and push brooms.
SarahBrown	training	Schultz	(But not all at once of course, ███████!)
SarahBrown	training	Henry	█████'s enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds; out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break.
SarahBrown	training	Henry	BETTY returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with █████'s temporary custodial care.
SarahBrown	training	Henry	All bets were off, no doggie for █████.
SarahBrown	training	Betty	We have the carefree, energy filled, free wheeling of the boy, the kindness of █████ and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation.
SarahBrown	training	Betty Boop	At any rate, this teaming was in many ways the best of the ██████████ try out pictures.
SarahBrown	training	Catwoman	There is a long list of these kind of movies, and in the end, some are really bad (Battlefield Earth (2000)), some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable (████████ (2004), Elektra (2005))
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	Well, when I heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies I was very sceptically, and although I really love ████████████ I stayed sceptically until I've finally seen this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	It never simply copies the original, it has a quite clever story, has tension, action, humor and the absolutely stunning ████████████ reprising the role of her life!
SarahBrown	training	Catherine Tramell	It's simply a pleasure to watch her as █████████████████, and all of the other actors deliver solid performances, too!
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Maybe the story isn't █████-caliber, but it never even tries to be!
SarahBrown	training	Judd Nelson's	I have been a fan of █████████████ work for many years, and he blew me away.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	I've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 (both done by █████████), and the 2001 is far better in comparison IMO.
SarahBrown	training	Hark	I'm begging you Mr. ████ - can we please have a sequel?
SarahBrown	training	Sam Waterston	It stars █████████████, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict, yet caring and wise fathers as in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Powell	A wonderful film by ██████ and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more.
SarahBrown	training	David Niven	Beautifully shot and acted, although ███████████ doesn't seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Attenborough	Fun to see a very young ████████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	But, for me Ms. █████' very poor attempt at an accent, and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	Seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Ms. █████ they would be laughed off the screen.
SarahBrown	training	Bette Davis	I guess I just don't 'get' ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Natella	"Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and ███████, our three ""protagonists"" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject."
SarahBrown	training	Blom	Hard to believe this is Ms. ████'s directorial debut, it is beautifully paced and performed.
SarahBrown	training	Anne Tyler	Large cast of characters could be out of an ██████████ novel, i.e. they are layered with back story and potential futures, there are no false notes, surprising bursts of humor amidst self-inflicted anxiety and very real if not earth-shattering dilemmas.
SarahBrown	training	Kurt Russell	But because it's not trying to give you a typically glib Hollywood style answer, ████████████ must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions.
SarahBrown	training	Brian	I would love to know if █████ does his own riding in the film.
SarahBrown	training	Brian	█████ has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	The shy, retiring █████ is slim and petite and appears to be the youngest of the three.
SarahBrown	training	Francois	The three, together with a handsome male swimmer named ████████, are involved in what might be described as a love-quadrilateral.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	Indeed, not all of Floriane's admirers are male, because █████ has a crush on her attractive friend.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	The film charts the way in which their friendship develops; at first it seems that Floriane is simply using █████ as a convenient excuse when she is in fact going out to meet boys; her parents presumably object to her dating boys, but have no objection to her going out with female friends.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	Later, however, we realise that, despite Floriane's image as the sexy, popular girl who is always the centre of male attention, she actually reciprocates █████'s feelings.
SarahBrown	training	Marie	(Is Floriane, for example, simply using █████ for sex, or does she genuinely have romantic feelings for her?
SarahBrown	training	Francois	Could Floriane's sluttish behaviour with ████████ and the other boys be just a device to hide her lesbian feelings from the outside world?
SarahBrown	training	Celine Sciamma	This was the first film made by its young director ██████████████ (only 27 at the time); on this basis she must be regarded as a highly promising newcomer.
SarahBrown	training	Dick Van Dyke's	The main cast gave good performances and ███████████████ entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic, dance and humor.
SarahBrown	training	Toshi	I also laughed and cried at the happy-go-lucky character, █████, who grew up with Sho.
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	"███████████: ""You were outside my house last night."
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	"And ███████ at a deliberate pace replies, ""Who are you?"
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	Does ███████████, who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines, die in the last wave?
SarahBrown	training	Sidney	Does the entirety of ██████?
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	Taken as a film, this one is pretty good, and it's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director, ██████████, and the Australian film industry.
SarahBrown	training	cooper	i loved ██████ his insight through out the show was just great.
SarahBrown	training	Jodie Foster	"This, however, does not apply to our ""known"" actors in this film, notably ████████████ (born a natural)."
SarahBrown	training	Jodie	The fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the story--█████ plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close, even with the obvious feeling of fatality.
SarahBrown	training	Donna	I love all of the characters, except I don't really care for █████.
SarahBrown	training	Laura Prepon	I just..don't find her funny, and I don't think ████████████ is a very good actress.
SarahBrown	training	Topher Grace	████████████ is also a great actor.
SarahBrown	training	Randy	█████ is horrible.
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	I believe Sarafina is a tremendous effort of ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Baker	When he was young, █████ was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death.
SarahBrown	training	Bruce	█████ looked a bit haggard but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs.
SarahBrown	training	Gary Kurtz	I put a lot of that down to the departure of producer ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Tatooine	First we are back on the desert planet ████████, and then we are watching them face ANOTHER death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new...
SarahBrown	training	Lando	"█████, an interesting character introduced in ""Empire"", here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle."
SarahBrown	training	Ian McDiarmid	█████████████ does excellent work as well as the Emperor.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	█████ is a very effective animatronic character, one of the most elaborate ever constructed.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	But on its own, it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and IMHO far superior to any of █████' later productions.
SarahBrown	training	PO Fischer	The most far-fetched was when ██████████ (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room... that would never happen.
SarahBrown	training	Moveis	██████ where money is not the most important thing.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	 I do wish we saw more of the █████ family.
SarahBrown	training	Leo Genn	And there will never be another the likes of ████████ as the emblematic British war hero on film.
SarahBrown	training	Alec	Not even Sir ████.
SarahBrown	training	Chris Saranden's	████████████████ Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed--very human while also divine.
SarahBrown	training	Rob	Repeating gags were ███ opening his locker (he had to use a yardstick or pointer to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things, finally kicking the spot whereupon his door would open), and taking pins out of a new shirt(at the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt, timing was everything and the pins got lots of laughs.)
SarahBrown	training	Marion Lorne	████████████ stole the show every time she was on screen.
SarahBrown	training	Wally	Why they didn't continue the series from her POV when █████ quit (he was afraid he was being typecast but by then it was way too late)I'll never know.
SarahBrown	training	Rob	It was ███ and Nancy (did I ever have the hots for her)
SarahBrown	training	Sharon Stone	It seems even more fashionable to trash ████████████ wholike all of usis now fourteen years older, andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful.
SarahBrown	training	Jerry Goldsmith	"""Basic Instinct 2"" is just an entertaining, average thriller, and besides the addition of ███████████████ original score, keeps little resemblance to its predecessor."
SarahBrown	training	Jennifer Thomas II	A female executioner (played by the sexy ██████████████████) has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker.
SarahBrown	training	Nabokov	"Not having read ███████, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view ""The Luzhin Defence"" as a movie."
SarahBrown	training	Donald Trump	████████████ is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well.
SarahBrown	training	Mark Burnett	████████████ may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes NYC look like a character unto itself.
SarahBrown	training	Ben-Hur	This documentary was interesting, but it was also long (so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes), like ███████ long.
SarahBrown	training	 Yellow	"""Jag är nyfiken ████████"" is a lot of fun."
SarahBrown	training	Bergman	Don't expect ███████ here.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	All the while, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring ████'s life - her home life, her loves, her political views, her view of herself.
SarahBrown	training	Sjöman	And placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, ██████, and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena.
SarahBrown	training	Bjork	I am reminded of a █████ music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish.
SarahBrown	training	Sjöman	I think ██████ may have had something similar in mind.
SarahBrown	training	 Yellow	"While ""Jag är nyfiken ████████"" may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly intelligent, witty, refreshing, ebullient, and authentic."
SarahBrown	training	Costner	Kutcher's is revealed further into than movie than ███████'s is.
SarahBrown	training	Mike Newell	Under the brush stroke direction of ███████████, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye.
SarahBrown	training	Emilio Miraglia's	█████████████████ first Giallo feature, The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave, was a great combination of Giallo and Gothic horror - and this second film is even better!
SarahBrown	training	Evelyn	It's obvious that the colour red is important to him, as it features heavily in both films; and he appears to have something against women called '██████'.
SarahBrown	training	Barbara Bouchet	The female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning ███████████████ and Marina Malfatti heading up an eye-pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off!
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Nicolai	The score courtesy of █████████████ is catchy, and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave; it fits the film well.
SarahBrown	training	Burt	"""Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and ████"" is in a similar style."
SarahBrown	training	Burt	After being allowed to stay, Adam and ████ witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show: the legendary Batmobile!
SarahBrown	training	Burt	Adam and ████ decide to chase after it themselves, leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show.
SarahBrown	training	Brett Rickaby	"█████████████ (""Frank Gorshin"") bears a stronger resemblance to his subject, but captures none of the late Gorshin's charm, only his characterizations."
SarahBrown	training	Lyle Waggoner's	Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of ███████████████ tryout for the part of Batman.
SarahBrown	training	Waggoner	Even the ████████ footage is technically movie footage.
SarahBrown	training	Waggoner	So when ████████ and West were testing for the role, it was for the movie, not the TV show.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII, don't expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, ████, etc.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Yes, the ████ is laughable.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Young	For one, the score by a then unknown █████████████████ is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly.
SarahBrown	training	Jessica	Quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but generally the standard is high and when it is not, ███████ is always worth looking at.
SarahBrown	training	Valerie	███████'s urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging Dark Angel into sitcom territory.
SarahBrown	training	Clutter	But no safe was ever found, and the two men instead wound up killing Mr. ███████, his wife, and their two children, getting away with only a radio, a pair of binoculars, and a lousy forty dollars.
SarahBrown	training	Holcomb	But it eventually comes out, after merciless grilling by Kansas law enforcement officials, that these two men committed that heinous crime in ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	█████ and Smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what they've done but are concerned about getting caught.
SarahBrown	training	Quincy Jones	The chilling jazz score by ████████████ is the capper.
SarahBrown	training	Bernard Malamud's	It totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of █████████████████ fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American.
SarahBrown	training	Emily Watson's	 Pure love, as personified by ██████████████ Natalia, can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously.
SarahBrown	training	Kelso	Red's foot in your ass comments never got old, nor did █████'s stupidity.
SarahBrown	training	Jessica Alba	It seems uneven, perhaps a result of a variety of authors, but is held together by the energetic, beautiful, and charming ████████████, who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive.
SarahBrown	training	Dresser	I just watched The ███████ this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	These are two men, each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of ██████ to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	And ██████ lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.
SarahBrown	training	Finney	██████, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor.
SarahBrown	training	Courtenay	And █████████ is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	For although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and ██████ act like nothing so much as an old married couple.
SarahBrown	training	Madge	There is a wonderful scene where Sir and █████ talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.
SarahBrown	training	Laurence Fishburne	██████████████████ was superb at playing a career petty criminal.
SarahBrown	training	Eamonn Walker	█████████████ added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Calderon	█████████████ was perfect as a grease monkey/drug lord.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver	"The secret was revealed by on a 2004 UK documentary titled ""██████!"
SarahBrown	training	Mark Lester	For the record, ███████████ retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.
SarahBrown	training	Jordi Molla	███████████, whose first directorial job this movie is, had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television.
SarahBrown	training	Molla	Mr. █████, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera.
SarahBrown	training	Candela Pena	████████████, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Superman	I just found a VHS tape of ████████ and the Mole Men at the flea market and decided to watch it again (it's been a lot of years).
SarahBrown	training	Superman	Forget the fact that ████████ went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their butts in the beginning, because then the story would have ended, right?!
SarahBrown	training	J. Farrell MacDonald	████████████████████ played old Pop and was always a great supporting actor in more movies than I can count.
SarahBrown	training	John Brambury	█████████████ was also a Munchkin.
SarahBrown	training	Hamm	It came on late at night, something you'd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of ████'s.
SarahBrown	training	Wally	"Highlights included segments like ""How to Properly Dispose of an Old Bowling Ball"" (chuck them into a lake) and ""Tips on Dating,"" where the duo ""date"" a couple of hookers and █████ ends with the bitter complaint, ""I could have done that myself!"""
SarahBrown	training	Wally	" █████'s awestruck comments about ""league bowlers,"" and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights."
SarahBrown	training	Ernie	The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters (█████, the Pig, Butch, etc.) were more distractions than anything else.
SarahBrown	training	Jon Stewart	Even ███████████ dissed Let's Bowl on the Daily Show -- (not enough lame, snide jokes?) -- an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better.
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike	█████████████ uses the fantasy genre, particularly, the children's fantasy genre, as a springboard into the wild territory that is the Great Yokai War.
SarahBrown	training	Pokemon	This ending, with it's Yokai spirit who is the spitting image of ███████'s Pikachu, warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves, but of the horrors of over-consumption.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	This is one of the first scripts █████ has contributed to, and I believe it shows, as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness.
SarahBrown	training	Miyazaki	There's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film, and the ████████ comparisons are warranted, as are the NeverEnding Story and Labrynth comparisons, though this film is sharper and more adult than either.
SarahBrown	training	Kate Winslet	The acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years, ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Melnik	You would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film!My only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Hank	Christ its bad!The prison guard ████ is woeful too.
SarahBrown	training	Jennifer Thomas	This movie is well watching alone for the beautiful,talented and very sexy ███████████████
SarahBrown	training	Merkerson	I always felt that Ms. █████████ had never gotten a role fitting her skills.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Smits	The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all kinds of people, played by some of the best actors in the business (I purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black, except for ███████████, of course)
SarahBrown	training	Eaves	It was a great step up from █████' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production.
SarahBrown	training	Bane	Can't wait for ████, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	If you are a fan of ████████████████ you will love it.
SarahBrown	training	Elvis	She swoons over █████, playing his records and wishfully thinking about love.
SarahBrown	training	Maureen	███████ her sister will soon be off to college, has no trouble with attracting boys, is beautiful, and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn't.
SarahBrown	training	Danni	█████ like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn't good enough.
SarahBrown	training	Maureen	She wants to be ███████ but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself.
SarahBrown	training	Danni	They yell and argue and █████ leaves.
SarahBrown	training	Danni	█████ becomes attracted to Court, and Court to Danni.
SarahBrown	training	Danni	 Court is 17 and █████ 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between Court working the farm.
SarahBrown	training	Danni	By the time Court kisses her one day, █████ is smitten.
SarahBrown	training	Maureen	The silence though is broken by his meeting with ███████ who has yet to see Court.
SarahBrown	training	Danni	The looks of pain and defeat on █████'s face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time.
SarahBrown	training	Brad Sykes	Zombie Chronicles isn't something to shout about, it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining B-movie directed by ██████████ who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick.
SarahBrown	training	gore	The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining, the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget, the ████ is also great and gross, the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale.
SarahBrown	training	Eisenhower	But whatever the value of those shadowy downers, they reflected a war-time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the ██████████ era.
SarahBrown	training	Myrnah Loy	So, with wife ██████████, they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside.
SarahBrown	training	Grant	The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage, with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving █████ a hard time.
SarahBrown	training	Grant	Of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than █████, so it's just one well-placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	With their live-in maid, the █████████ may not be a typical American family, but that post-war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical.
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	"And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than █████████ as an ""ad-man"" tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ""ham""."
SarahBrown	training	Blandings	Oh sure, the feeling falters at times, yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the █████████ just stick to their dream carries them through.
SarahBrown	training	Majorcan	I must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors, who managed to sound really ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Harry Beaumont	Dance, Fools, Dance -- one of *four* films that ██████████████ directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long, yet its characters are well developed, its story never seems rushed, and despite its many twists in plot, the audience is never left behind.
SarahBrown	training	Joan Crawford's	But this is ███████████████ film, and she absolutely shines in it.
SarahBrown	training	Crawford	Made when she was just 27, this lesser-known version of ████████ will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	I saw █████████████ back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on T.V. or video.
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	It was always one of my favorite sci-fi and/or ███████████████ films.
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	Recently, the Egyptian theater in L.A. had a twelve film ███████████████ retrospective.
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	█████████████ looked great on the large Egyptian screen with a perfect new print.
SarahBrown	training	Fleisher	████████ really knows how to fill the screen,and the cinematoraphy, writing, music used, and everything about it works.
SarahBrown	training	Charlton Heston	Speaking of reputations, often people speak as if ███████████████ is not a great actor.
SarahBrown	training	Nicholas Katzenbach	Never having seen this movie, based on the entertaining novel by ███████████████████, and taking into consideration the first rate cast assembled for the production, we decided to take a look.
SarahBrown	training	Jeb Stuart	"""Just Cause"", while not a horrible film, takes too many liberties with the original material that ██████████ didn't quite succeed in his treatment."
SarahBrown	training	Arne Glimcher	█████████████ directed.
SarahBrown	training	Armstrong	She old woman is convincing enough for █████████ to take a look at the case.
SarahBrown	training	Armstrong	The way it plays in the movie, it serves to confuse the viewer and distract █████████ from arriving at the truth.
SarahBrown	training	Laurence Fishburne	██████████████████, an intense actor, makes a fine impression as the Sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner.
SarahBrown	training	Ed Harris	█████████ has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors.
SarahBrown	training	Barbeau	Ms. ███████ is a miracle to behold.
SarahBrown	training	Ma	And the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if Hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother, then why doesn't she just kill ██ in the film's very first sequence?
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	█████████████ gives a wonderful performance in this well-made French melodrama.
SarahBrown	training	Andre	She sees opportunity in a beauty contest for Miss Europe, but █████ is furious when he discovers that she's entered, then demands that she withdraw.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	The performances were very good by all the principals, but that of █████████████ is especially memorable.
SarahBrown	training	Louise	██████ leans heavily on her silent screen skills even though this is a talkie, but because her silent style had a surprisingly contemporary, understated feel, she makes the transition to talkies very well.
SarahBrown	training	Louise	The long early scene at the fair was especially poignant as ██████ used her remarkably expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation, of being trapped in a life she no longer wants.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	And the tragic storyline only underscores the greater tragedy that this is the final starring role for █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	G.W. Pabst	This movie is less well known than her German films with ██████████, but I think it's a better one.
SarahBrown	training	Louise Brooks	Bottom line, this is a classic █████████████ film well worth looking for.
SarahBrown	training	Albert Finney	There is nothing to add, except that is a terrible shame that sir █████████████ still isn't accepted by the AMPAS (American Academy).
SarahBrown	training	Gundam	I just re-watched 08th MS ██████ for the 2nd time.
SarahBrown	training	Gundam Wing	It is so much better than ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Jeremy Clarkson	"I have to say that sometimes ""looks"" are all that matters, just like ███████████████ from BBC has pointed out (not about our earth though, but he is right anyway)."
SarahBrown	training	Arthur	"In one such scene, ██████ (drunk throughout most of the story) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human 'siren' (""My husband has a gun!!!!)."
SarahBrown	training	Dudley Moore	It's a shame the late ████████████ passed away last month (March 2002).
SarahBrown	training	Trey Parker	I just goes to show that not only is ███████████ adept at writing he's not too shabby at the old acting game either.
SarahBrown	training	Zentropa	But, then I saw ████████ (Europa) and my faith was renewed.
SarahBrown	training	Max Von Sydow	The narrator (█████████████) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945.
SarahBrown	training	Keith Gordon's	After seeing ██████████████ film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future.
SarahBrown	training	Sheryl Lee	"He takes the story of Campbell as a story of a fractured life: a German propaganda master (the ""only American left in Berlin""), who is actually a spy for the Americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to ""a nation of two"", himself and his wife (██████████)."
SarahBrown	training	Mother Night	████████████ can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the Pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film.
SarahBrown	training	Goebbels	Campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line ████████ said): the bigger the lie, the more people believe it.
SarahBrown	training	Vonnegut	But it's the subversion from ████████ that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering.
SarahBrown	training	Donald Sutherland	It's always great to see █████████████████ and here he's wonderful as the callous father of Macy.
SarahBrown	training	Matthew Lillard	I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, ███████████████ (I'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	"So they (mainly ████) call her ""Mars Girl""."
SarahBrown	training	Matt	One more comment on ████:
SarahBrown	training	Valeria Golino	I know this is a review, but I need to make a correction towards NeCRo, one of the reviewers: ██████████████ is not a newcomer.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie Sheen's	"To me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as ███████████████ Italian love interest in both the ""Hot Shots!"" movies."
SarahBrown	training	Richard Benjamin	████████████████ appears as Matthau's nephew, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality.
SarahBrown	training	Altman	"In the classic sense of the four humors (which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment), ██████'s ""H.E.A.L.T.H."" treats all of the humors, and actually in very funny, entertaining ways."
SarahBrown	training	Altman	This is ██████ at his classic best.
SarahBrown	training	Josie Lawrence	I only watched this because it starred ██████████████, who I knew from Whose Line is it Anyway?, the wacky British improvisational comedy show.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	With that said, the ██████ series has been fantastic.
SarahBrown	training	Doug Liman	██████████ ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style, showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Greengrass	With director ███████████████ taking over, what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Once again, ██████ is brought into the minds of the CIA by false pretenses.
SarahBrown	training	Pamela Landy	Only ████████████, she who was on the case to find him in Supremacy, knows that he can't be the one.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	██████'s motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	What ends up transpiring is that ██████ wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	The film, then, becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends, or if ██████ can get his revenge on those who took his life from him.
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight, between ██████ and the CIA's second asset, alone.
SarahBrown	training	Matt Damon	No one could have done it better than ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	David Strathairn	Needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Cox	Like ███, he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision.
SarahBrown	training	Blackbriar	With as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the ██████████ program as he is trying to do his duty to his country, you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Greengrass	In the end, one has to applaud ███████████████ for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them.
SarahBrown	training	Tony Scott	His skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as ██████████, but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts.
SarahBrown	training	Eva	The simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after ███, an unemployed mother of two, discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer.
SarahBrown	training	Burt Reynolds	I love old █████████████ movies.
SarahBrown	training	Loni Anderson	I used to have this magazine that had █████████████ in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner.
SarahBrown	training	K. Marx	"Here are some of Slavoj utterances (most as paraphrases): ""desire is a wound on reality"", ""fantasy realized is a nightmare"", ""music is the opium of the people"" (borrowing from ███████), ""of all human emotions, anxiety is the only one that is not deceiving""."
SarahBrown	training	Hitler	A visit by ██████ in Rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism.
SarahBrown	training	Il Duce	She would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of ███████.
SarahBrown	training	Marcello Mastroianni	Across the yard sits ████████████████████ on his chair contemplating suicide.
SarahBrown	training	Loren	█████ proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed.
SarahBrown	training	D'Amato	This one is more of a throwback to the original 'Emmanuelle' trilogy(especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') than a ███████ sleazefest.
SarahBrown	training	William H Macy	██████████████ is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was just amazing.
SarahBrown	training	Neve Campbell	He makes you care for his character, even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing, and █████████████ gives a performance that is with out a doubt the best performance I have seen by an actress this year.
SarahBrown	training	Judy Davis	██████████ shows us here why she is one of Australia's most respected and loved actors - her portrayal of a lonely, directionless nomad is first-rate.
SarahBrown	training	Claudia Karvan	A teenaged ██████████████ also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of this country's most popular actors in years to come, with future roles in THE BIG STEAL, THE HEARTBREAK KID, DATING THE ENEMY, RISK and the acclaimed TV series THE SECRET LIFE OF US.
SarahBrown	training	Mardi Gras	██████████ beads - who would have thought??
SarahBrown	training	Steve Carell	████████████ has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on 'The Daily Show', and then in various supporting roles.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	████ is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, ████ accidentally reveals that he is a virgin.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	But it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that ████ is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	And so begins ████'s quest into adulthood.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	████ is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film.
SarahBrown	training	Andy	In addition, I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as ████ finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life.
SarahBrown	training	pete	they have some really good actors in this thing.. the head coach guy and the player that likes ████ were very good and the plot has already got me
SarahBrown	training	Jeremy sumpter	but i don't really understand how they'll keep it stretched for a whole season.. there will probably be some big twist tho..i cant wait till Tuesday.. finally ██████████████ who is he?
SarahBrown	training	Amadeus	All the folks who sit here and say that this movie's weak link is the Ramones would probably say that ███████ was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist.
SarahBrown	training	Randell	Nevermind the Riff ███████ character.
SarahBrown	training	Philo Vance	The film begins at the dog show and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, though this ███████████ film actually spends little of the time at the dog show and dogs are not a super-important part of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Steve Gordon	I remember trying a few minutes of this film, I'm very surprised I didn't watch all of it, from director ████████████, his only film directed before dying of heart failure.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	"It won the █████ for Best Song for ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)"" (it also won the Golden Globe)"
SarahBrown	training	John Gielgud	Sir ████████████ was number 35 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 53 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.
SarahBrown	training	Newsreel	Years ago many big studios promoted serial films that were shown in movie theaters's in between the actual features along with a ████████ of current events, plus cartoons, especially on a Saturday afternoon.
SarahBrown	training	"Wong"",'34"	"Lugosi),""The Mysterious Mr. █████████ is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of Lemuria to rescue the kidnapped princess of Egypt,(Nadji)Maria Alba,""Dr."
SarahBrown	training	Brendan	Forget that ███████ is a graduate of the Buffy universe.
SarahBrown	training	Adrienne Barbeau	████████████████ is giving a rock solid performance--
SarahBrown	training	Ned	such was ███'s Bravery.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	In Australia and especially country Victoria the name █████████ can be said and immediately recognised.
SarahBrown	training	Greta	In █████ he is still a Hero, the life Blood of the Town of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	███ was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	It is not self justification it is ███'s biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	So go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ███ stood for.
SarahBrown	training	Lion King	█████████ 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel.
SarahBrown	training	Damion Crowley	 ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Sky+	I'm 15 and have been watching the show since I was 12, recoding it onto my ████ box everyday from Hallmark and BBC 1.
SarahBrown	training	Suspense	It Was A Very Interesting Movie,Filled With Drama And ████████,From The Beginning To The Very End.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	████ appears uneasy in the office environment, is it that he's just not cut out for work?
SarahBrown	training	Carla	One is when █████ is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly'	I didn't know what to expect from '██████████, but absolutely loved it.
SarahBrown	training	Luque	Peretti and █████ join their efforts to fight against a cold and daringly foe in a time when it's difficult to trust someone.
SarahBrown	training	Kenneth Branagh	"This begs the question why Castle Rock Entertainment allowed ███████████████ to create a full-length, uncut version of ""Hamlet"" with his complete creative control among other things."
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	According to some, ███████████ never intended for the play to be produced uncut, leaving the decision of what to include to the director's discretion.
SarahBrown	training	Judi Dench	The classical actors are cast in bit parts (██████████ is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines), but at least they're in it.
SarahBrown	training	Robin Williams	██████████████ is a little too silly, but he's not bad (his part is pretty small anyway).
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	What I really liked about this film is that you don't have to be a ███████████ scholar to enjoy it.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	As most people know, ███████████ is difficult to digest, but Branagh and his cast understand this.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Duffel's	A common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate tales██████████████ film wisely doesn't pay too much attention to that.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Bloch	High expectations are allowed for this film, since it was entirely written by ████████████!
SarahBrown	training	Peter Duffel's	Yes, the same Bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone `Psycho' We're also marking ██████████████ solid and very professional debut as a director.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Cushing	The second story stars (Hammer) horror-legend █████████████ as a retired stockbroker.
SarahBrown	training	Cushing	███████ is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of Wax Museums isn't new  this story looks overall fresh and innovating.
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Lee	Another legendary actor in this one, as ███████████████ gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father.
SarahBrown	training	Ingrid Pitt	Most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ███████████!
SarahBrown	training	Thalberg	Sure, 65 years have passed since ████████'s last production was filmed.
SarahBrown	training	Luise Rainer	"Last week, those watching the Academy Awards had a glimpse of the ""senior"" Oscar winner in attendance, ████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Jack	Having chronic Insomnia, ████ is plagued by hallucinations; causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn't.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	"We find out interesting things about ████ near the end, and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a ""happily ever after"" Hollywood ending."
SarahBrown	training	Tess Nanavati	█████████████ (Writer and Director) has herself a good film in 'An Insomniac's Nightmare'.
SarahBrown	training	Stanley Kubrick's	When i first went to watch The Shining I was expecting a decent film from what I had heard about it and I liked a lot of █████████████████ other work but when I started to watch it it was so much better than I thought it would be.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Nicholson	██████████████ gives an awesome performance.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	"My introduction to Ms. ██████ was a ""clip"" from this film; the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions."
SarahBrown	training	Haines	My introduction to Mr. ██████ was in viewing this film, presently; though, it's possible I've seen him in a less memorable role.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	The story starts off with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) driving daughter ██████ into Hollywood, certain she will become Tinseltown's newest sensation.
SarahBrown	training	Haines	Indeed, Davies and the already arrived ██████ become comedy stars.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	But, ██████ yearns to become a true drama queen.
SarahBrown	training	Hadley Kay	But Darkheart, while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain, and ██████████ did a superb job voicing him.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	"Make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees █████████████ but it is something to the effect of ""I don't think I like her!"""
SarahBrown	training	Ettore Scola's	██████████████ movie,probably his masterpiece, focuses on the outcasts,the scapegoats of the regime.
SarahBrown	training	Sophia	"""Genius is essentially masculine"" :this is the golden rule Antonietta (a never better ██████ Loren)embroidered on her cushion;Antonietta ,whose world amounts to her kitchen,whose pride is her offsprings .At"
SarahBrown	training	Gabriel	███████,on the contrary ,is politically aware,he knows about the cancer that is destroying inexorably his country.
SarahBrown	training	Law	In ███ is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating 'Divorce, Iranian Style' which was as exactly as it stated, as we got a glimpse of Divorce court in Iran.
SarahBrown	training	Aunt	One of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an ████.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	███████ is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog, Carface.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	But when ███████ wants revenge he comes back to Earth with a watch that can't stop ticking or that's the end of his life again.
SarahBrown	training	Ann-Marie	But he ends up learning that maybe he should put █████████ first before himself when Carface goes back to him with a vengeance.
SarahBrown	training	McBain	██████ is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle.
SarahBrown	training	Walken	when ██████ and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money), the snapping of necks, the guys on fire, the guys that get blown off buildings, and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings.
SarahBrown	training	Walken	"██████ is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as, ""let's go sit..........out on the deck."""
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	███████ and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-plots and in-jokes.
SarahBrown	training	Reeves	However, Riffen and ██████ pull it off.
SarahBrown	training	Reeves	I also think it is about the best thing ██████ ever did.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie	Some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons, like the dream sequence of ███████, but everything else was okay,and the songs were fair.
SarahBrown	training	Judith Barsi	And ████████████ of Jaws The Revenge, may God rest her soul, poor girl, she didn't deserve to die, but she is in Heaven now, all good people go to Heaven.
SarahBrown	training	Dom DeLuise	And know this, if you have the original video of this, you'll find after the movie, ███████████ has a very important and special message, gotta love that guy, ahehehe.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart Granger	The will to do harm to another...  When he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker (███████████████)
SarahBrown	training	Taylor	██████'s shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts...
SarahBrown	training	Debra Paget	He even tries to romance a beautiful squaw (███████████) who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort...
SarahBrown	training	Taylor	But ██████ steals the show...
SarahBrown	training	Richard Brooks	██████████████ captures (in CinemaScope and Technicolor) distant view of Buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animals...
SarahBrown	training	Mendez	██████ and Marichal have provided us with a serious, cogent and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism have spawned in Puerto Rico.
SarahBrown	training	Bacall	And to top it all off ██████ is supposed to be an English aristocrat!
SarahBrown	training	Lorre	Despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good - especially those of Paxinou and █████.
SarahBrown	training	Lorre	But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and █████ meet, and talk in wildly different accents, is a real hoot!
SarahBrown	training	Ilka Järvilaturi	Darkness in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film but it was made by a Finnish director ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Powell	Director ██████████████ once stated that this was his favorite movie, and it is mine as well.
SarahBrown	training	Powell	"██████ and Pressburger created a seemingly simple, superbly crafted story - the power of love against ""the powers that be""."
SarahBrown	training	Marius Goring	But, in my opinion, the film's charm comes from █████████████ as Conductor 71.
SarahBrown	training	Goring	It is also a pity that ██████'s comedic talents are rarely seen again on film, except in the wonderful videos of The Scarlet Pimpernel television series from the 1950s.
SarahBrown	training	Niven	He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of █████, and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters.
SarahBrown	training	Powell	██████ and Pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasn't necessary.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	█████ makes a children's adventure film, not unlike The Neverending Story.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	Even the worst █████ is better than a good many films, though, and The Great Yokai War has a lot in it that's worth recommending.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	I might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it (the DVD includes an English dub), but, like all of █████'s films, it can tend to move very slowly.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	The story itself isn't very good, either, and █████'s perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	This has to be █████'s most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic.
SarahBrown	training	Agi	I especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), ███, who sports dark eye shadow, a tight, white outfit, a white beehive hairdo and a whip.
SarahBrown	training	Ryunosuke Kamiki	The hero of the film is played by ████████████████, who provided voices for Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Brosnon's	Not to mention easily ████████████████ best performance.
SarahBrown	training	Greg Kinnear	Of course ████████████ is always great.
SarahBrown	training	LEILA VR	I only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die, until they disappear; and some frustrating situations on the ████████ missions, when riding the bike, here and there...
SarahBrown	training	Bip	There's the idiotic principal, Mr. ███, the nervous Maths teacher and many others.
SarahBrown	training	Rosenstrasse	"""████████████,"" which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film."
SarahBrown	training	Hannah	A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested ██████ about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in Berlin.
SarahBrown	training	Hannah	██████ is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	As the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories ████ tells her story, the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	The young ████ tries to locate her husband.
SarahBrown	training	Reich	As in the real story the Nazis gave in, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the █████ of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story).
SarahBrown	training	Von Trotta	██████████ builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trotta	██████████ makes that point very well.
SarahBrown	training	Ruth	The older ████ is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life.
SarahBrown	training	Hannah	██████ is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trotta's	████████████ hand is sure but not perfect.
SarahBrown	training	Hitler	The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical top-level ██████ worshiper, to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives.
SarahBrown	training	Erich von Stroheim	"Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the ██████████████████ ""copy and paste"" school of Teutonic nastiness."
SarahBrown	training	Rosenstrasse	The ████████████ story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested.
SarahBrown	training	Rosenstrasse	THAT'S why the ████████████ protest was virtually singular.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	"The elderly ████ remarks that what was accomplished by the women was ""a ray of light"" in an evil time."
SarahBrown	training	Bourne	Like all the ██████ movies the action is fast paced, realistic and intense.
SarahBrown	training	Franka Potente	I do miss ██████████████ though.
SarahBrown	training	Cary Grant	Another example of the unique talents of ██████████.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	A performance worthy of █████ consideration, yet once again shunned by the Academy.
SarahBrown	training	Grant	Mr. █████ runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Hanks	"The pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis (loosely) for the more modern █████████ vehicle, ""The Money Pit""."
SarahBrown	training	Boyer	"Also, it's a bit ridiculous when people say things to █████ like, ""You're Spanish, aren't you?"""
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been exceedingly hard on █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	█████████ is getting away with life perfectly, being totally taken care of, getting and giving what he wants.
SarahBrown	training	marie	the girls are allowing this, veronika loves sex, █████ is his patron.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	Ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in █████████'s position, in an urban area can ask for.
SarahBrown	training	Ruben Santiago-Hudson	LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, engrossing, emotionally-charged HBO-TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor █████████████████████ (who also appears in a small role).
SarahBrown	training	"Rachel ""Nanny"""	This joyous motion picture experience is centered around Santiago-Hudson's childhood guardian, ██████████████ Crosby, a strong, big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate New York during the 1950's.
SarahBrown	training	an Emmy Award	Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent, in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	S. Epatha Merkeson	Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored, this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels, but if for no other reason, is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by ██████████████████, who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it.
SarahBrown	training	Beckham	"""Bend It Like ███████"" is a film that got very little exposure here in the United States."
SarahBrown	training	Soylent Green	This is a great movie but there could be more about █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	John McIntire	Along the way they meet the man who runs the gold-crazy town behind a dishonest lawman █████████████...
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	In spontaneous manner, ███████ is lost between the ostentatious saloon owner and the wife-candidate...
SarahBrown	training	Graham Greene	"█████████████ has been translated into film many times of course, in such masterpieces as ""Thin Man"" and in lesser vehicles."
SarahBrown	training	Boyer	I was compelled to watch, not by any great acting (although █████ is marvelous as usual, managing to convey a rich mixture of world-weariness, tragedy, hope, and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes), but by the down-spiraling rush of one man's slim hopes against a world of oppression and money.
SarahBrown	training	Fishburne	There is a little overplay sometimes, but I think it fits quite well to the general orientation █████████ gave to the movie, which gives matter for reflexion more than just being a good style exercise, notably in the time/action management.
SarahBrown	training	B. Marsalis	By the way I much enjoyed the soundtrack (███████████).
SarahBrown	training	eddie murphy's	during ██████████████ stand up a women from the audience yells at eddie and a man from the audience responds.
SarahBrown	training	ROB	what is said is,, women - DO MR ███ (this is a character from Saturday night live), the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH.
SarahBrown	training	ROB	despite what the post-er says about not being able to here it on DVD have a close listen as you actually can hear it on the DVD - DO MR ███!!!!
SarahBrown	training	Dolittle	"The omission of ""In Cold Blood"" in 1967 as one of the five Best Picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances, especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable ""Dr. ████████."""
SarahBrown	training	Conrad Hall	"Based on a Nebraska multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place, ""In Cold Blood"" was filmed by master cinematographer ███████████ in stark black and white, and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio."
SarahBrown	training	Clutter	Some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals, their backgrounds, and lives, while the ███████ family, which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night, come across as one-dimensional characters of little import.
SarahBrown	training	Capote	This lack of balance comes from the book as ██████ spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row.
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey	████████████ is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much cash.
SarahBrown	training	Posey	█████ gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler.
SarahBrown	training	Parker Posey	I believe ████████████ is the PERFECT actress for this kind of character: young, fabulous and broke.
SarahBrown	training	Noonan	The acting is all up to ██████ and he carries his thankless character perfectly.
SarahBrown	training	Picasso	███████ was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime.
SarahBrown	training	Lorne Greene	████████████ was dominant as the patriarch of the family.
SarahBrown	training	Ben Cartwright	We often were left to wonder that ██████████████, a widower, must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died.
SarahBrown	training	Pernell Roberts	Naturally, we all wondered why ███████████████ left the show.
SarahBrown	training	Roberts	The show was a gold mine and ███████ surrendered loads of money when he departed.
SarahBrown	training	Cartwright	His career never took off as he was associated as a ██████████ son.
SarahBrown	training	CJ	I'll keep it short and brief, the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius, the actors are just perfect for the roles they play (██'s character is legendary) and they have so much chemistry on screen which makes it what it is, a very successful comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Taylor's	███████████████ against-type role as the possessed buffalo and Indian killer is his finest performance.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price's	But the climatic scene in The Last Hunt is as horrifying as ███████████████ mutation in The Fly.
SarahBrown	training	Bronson	The laugh here is that ███████ used to play Indians.
SarahBrown	training	Linclon	███████ signed the Congressional act which authorized the continental railroad and started the buffalo slaughter.
SarahBrown	training	John Ritter	Sadly, ███████████ died during the series, and it put a damper on things.
SarahBrown	training	James Garner	████████████ was a good addition.
SarahBrown	training	Ritter	It could have lasted longer had ██████ lived.
SarahBrown	training	Ed O'Neill	I especially loved it when they brought in ██████████ in a guest spot.
SarahBrown	training	Rosenstrasse	This film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before--namely about the ████████████ (a street in Berlin)uprising of German gentile women who were married to Jews at the end of the Second World War.
SarahBrown	training	Anne Frank	"As such, it is a unique story, and what's more, is the only film about the Holocaust that I have ever seen that shows that there were GOOD Germans (the helping family in ""██████████"" for instance was Dutch) who did NOT support the Nazis, and, in fact, had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their very lives."
SarahBrown	training	Von Trotta	The acting is great across the board, the framing story in New York interesting and intricate, the direction from ██████████ masterful in every scene, and the production values, including the gorgeous cinematography, outstanding.
SarahBrown	training	Hitler	I am hoping this film gets some distribution is North America, for not only is this film a masterpiece, but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the Germans because of their support of ██████.
SarahBrown	training	Antone Fisher	I went to see █████████████ not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised.
SarahBrown	training	Derek Luke	The acting job by ██████████ was outstanding and the story line was excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Denzel Washington	Of course █████████████████ did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	I am an avid █████████████ fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Director's Cut version.
SarahBrown	training	Andrew	It was a beautiful showcase of ██████'s voice and talent.
SarahBrown	training	Julie	I would have liked to see the the relationship between █████ and Rock blossom, so that the intense love would be more believable.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	Yes, there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit ███████, but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a couple of mistakes.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	"In as selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose ourselves in ""The Christmas Carol"", starring ███████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Fraulein Doktor	███████████████ is certainly well-placed in the latter.
SarahBrown	training	Fraulein	Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of Deutschland, all the while in the throes of morphine addiction, die ████████ is treated very shabbily by the German high command despite all of her efforts.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Burton	Only the emotional pain presented by ██████████████ in the Spy Who Came in from the Cold comes close.
SarahBrown	training	Fraulein Doktor	███████████████ is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing.
SarahBrown	training	Dennis Leary	It reminds me of the ████████████ joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	I've read a few negative comments in here about Hope █████ but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	There are lots of good chuckles as ███████ sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing.
SarahBrown	training	Julian	"My father (a consultant) nearly lost it when ██████ describes himself as a ""facilitator""."
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	The scene where ███████████ loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	Good acting by all the actors especially ███████████ amidst criticism from the Indian public
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with ███████████ turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	The anguishing sequence in that film was when ████ is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious.
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	He is about to be destroyed when ███████████, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master.
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader V.s Luke Skywalker	I personally like the script and the battle of Endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of Star Wars between ██████████████████████████████ on the Death Star.
SarahBrown	training	Tess Nanavati	█████████████ is a relatively new directer and writer so I think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic	The acting (outside of ███████) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	If you love ████████████████ as much as I do, I say go for it.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic	I know fans of ███████ will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Brooks	IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Truman Capote	Recounting the brutal killing of a Midwest family, author █████████████ focused on minutia, wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject AND subjects!
SarahBrown	training	Brooks	██████ departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama.
SarahBrown	training	Hakuna Matata'	██████████████ is an irreverent new take on a classic tale.
SarahBrown	training	Pumbaa	It's basically the events of 'The Lion King' as told from Timon and ██████'s perspective.
SarahBrown	training	Hakuna Matata'	But that doesn't stop it from being hilarious, which, IMO, is '██████████████ in a nutshell.
SarahBrown	training	Pumbaa	Seriously, did you expect anything else in a film where ██████ takes centre stage?
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	███████████████ is particularly welcome.
SarahBrown	training	Hakuna Matata'	In the end, Timon and Pumbaa are awesome characters, and while it may be argued that '██████████████ is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and assorted compromising situations then so be it.
SarahBrown	training	George Clooney	The rest of the actors are also good and if you're a ██████████████ fan, you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Brown	Also, ███████████, the great actress, singer, comedienne and gay icon, gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked.
SarahBrown	training	Julie	█████ is 'absolutely fabulous':P So basically, this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s.
SarahBrown	training	John Denver	A Christmas Together actually came before my time, but I've been raised on ███████████ and the songs from this special were always my family's Christmas music.
SarahBrown	training	Harris	To me, the final scene, in which ██████ responds to the press corp, is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics(especially the campaign phase).
SarahBrown	training	Harris	"If only the ""real-life"" pols would respond in the intelligent, articulate manner as did Mr ██████,then the arrogant, self-serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant, confrontational ""garbage"" that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he/she is pursuing."
SarahBrown	training	Stanley Kubrick	There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	███████ proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time.
SarahBrown	training	Kubrick	Music has been a major part of ███████'s movies (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one.
SarahBrown	training	Nicholson	Finally, I must comment on █████████'s legendary performance.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	████ is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer.
SarahBrown	training	Soraj	Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times █████ creates something thats hard to find.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid	██████ has done fine work.
SarahBrown	training	Amrita Rao	██████████ quit different even though I felt that someway the other to me she doesn't suit in that role.
SarahBrown	training	Vladimir Nabokov	The scenario is based on the novel by ████████████████ and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant.
SarahBrown	training	Turturro	████████ definitely gives his best performance to date proving he's worth much more than what we thought.
SarahBrown	training	Watson	██████ also performs brilliantly.
SarahBrown	training	Turturro	The story is about a phenomenal chess player (████████) which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life.
SarahBrown	validation	David Spade	I am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put ███████████ in this show since he was done with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me!
SarahBrown	validation	Sabu	I do believe that ████ had to have influenced the director's of 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Run, Lola, Run'.
SarahBrown	validation	sturm und	If you want insight, culture, █████████ drang, go somewhere else.
SarahBrown	validation	Teri Hatcher	This was the first time I'd seen the always charming ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Moriarty	████████ absolutely shines in this movie, just as she had everywhere else she's appeared.
SarahBrown	validation	anti-Celeste-co	"I HATE YOU YOU CREEP!"" or give one of her ███████████████-conspirators an evil grin, and she has me rolling in the aisles."
SarahBrown	validation	Cathy Moriarty	Yes, ██████████████ is a very gifted actress, and one hell of a comedienne.
SarahBrown	validation	Sally Field gratefully	██████████████████████ departs from the usual 70-MM-sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies, and we're all reminded why she is who she is today, having started off in comedy afraid of nothing.
SarahBrown	validation	Carrie Fisher	How lucky were the producers to land █████████████, if only for a glorified cameo.
SarahBrown	validation	Elisabeth Shue	How lucky was ██████████████ to get thrown in the middle of all this!
SarahBrown	validation	Sutherland	Macy is the dutiful son, ██████████ is the domineering father.
SarahBrown	validation	David Dorfman	"Macy loves his own son, played beautifully by █████████████ (""The Ring"")."
SarahBrown	validation	Neve Campbell	He also starts to fall in love with █████████████, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office.
SarahBrown	validation	William Macy	And as you'd expect in a film with ████████████ in it, there's a bit of humor too.
SarahBrown	validation	Harris	Was Buddy Wittenborn bisexual or his love for ██████ was a fraternal love?
SarahBrown	validation	Hawn	████ is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians.
SarahBrown	validation	Sarandon	To talk about ████████ would be to give a lot away.
SarahBrown	validation	Steven Spielberg	The fact is, ████████████████, probably our greatest story-teller, has been doing this in various movie formats for years.
SarahBrown	validation	Spielberg	In hindsight, this film should have come as no surprise, for █████████ had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in E.T. Critics called COLOR PURPLE his entrance into intellectual fare.
SarahBrown	validation	Alice Walker	No special effects, no swashbuckling, just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Spielberg	One surprise is how █████████ could present such a moving film about African-Americans in the deep south.
SarahBrown	validation	Spielberg	 █████████ is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience.
SarahBrown	validation	Walker	The PG-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the ██████ novel.
SarahBrown	validation	Goldberg	████████ perfectly plays a human being, someone in need of love and someone who deserves it.
SarahBrown	validation	Spielberg	█████████ bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens.
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt Russell	████████████ is so believable and the action so non-stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest-to-goodness important themes [overcoming fear of The Stranger, learning to rise above early conditioning, the strength that love and friendship can bring, etc.] in the storyline.
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt Vonnegut	Although I like █████████████, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one.
SarahBrown	validation	Nick Nolte	"The only reason I watched it was ██████████, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda""."
SarahBrown	validation	Nolte	Of course █████ was great, but so was the plot.
SarahBrown	validation	Hitler	There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	William Tracy	I particularly like █████████████ as Pepi.
SarahBrown	validation	Shohei Sugiyama	But when ███████████████ becomes obsessed with meeting the beautiful young girl he sees in the window of a dance studio, he suddenly finds himself enrolled in dance classes.
SarahBrown	validation	Der Untergang	I think you can compare the film with █████████████, The pianist.
SarahBrown	validation	Suess	That may be so, but the addition of the narrator and Dr.█████ like scenery makes this show a must watch.
SarahBrown	validation	Bravo ABC	█████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Bette Davis	███████████ shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was.
SarahBrown	validation	Bette Davis	I would recommend this film to those interested in that era, and, of course, the fabulous films of the late, great, Ms. ███████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Andrew Marshall	Writer ███████████████ has written something that is funny, foreboding and occasionally frightening!
SarahBrown	validation	Denzel Washington	Definitely another great movie with █████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Derek Luke	(shouldn't surprise anyone) ██████████ did a wonderful job as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Dickens	The setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of ███████' classic tale.
SarahBrown	validation	George C. Scott	███████████████ is very believable as is the rest of the cast.
SarahBrown	validation	Dickens	The 19th Century English town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to ███████ and adds to the plausibility of this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Grinch	It is a movie I watch every Christmas along with the real ██████
SarahBrown	validation	Martino	"""The Case Of The Scorpion's Tale"" of 1971 is one of these impressive films ███████ has contributed to Italian Horror's most original sub-genre, and another proof that the man is a master of atmosphere, style and suspense."
SarahBrown	validation	Martino	"My personal favorite of the ███████ films I've seen so far is still the insanely brilliant ""Your Vice Is A Locked Room"
SarahBrown	validation	Lynch	Soon after █████ begins to investigate, a person is brutally killed, which is just the beginning of a series of murders...
SarahBrown	validation	Bruno Nicolai	The film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning, the score by █████████████ is brilliant, the plot is wonderfully convoluted, and the killer's identity remains a mystery until the end.
SarahBrown	validation	George Hilton	Regular Giallo leading-man █████████████ once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead.
SarahBrown	validation	Sexy Anita Strindberg	█████████████████████ is absolutely ravishing in the female lead.
SarahBrown	validation	Bruno Nicolai's	The atmosphere is constantly gripping, and the photography great, and ███████████████ ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense.
SarahBrown	validation	Sergio Martino	"Long story short: ""La Coda Dello Scorpione"" is another excellent Giallo from ██████████████ and an absolute must-see for any lover of the sub-genre!"
SarahBrown	validation	t.v.	That's what ████ should be.
SarahBrown	validation	Family Guy	50 years from now... clips of the Simpsons, ██████████, and South Park will be also scrutinized, analyzed... and even vilified by future viewers.
SarahBrown	validation	Helen Mirren	Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child' has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these British dramas but of course the beautiful ████████████ easily dominates; our eyes never leave her while she's on-screen.
SarahBrown	validation	Jane Tennison's	The search for the lost child of the title leads Superintendent ███████████████ CID team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters.
SarahBrown	validation	Billy Zane	██████████ is stunning as the central character, and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy.
SarahBrown	validation	Ron Pearlman	████████████ for example.
SarahBrown	validation	Zane	I still find my self giggling at the scene where ████ prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style.
SarahBrown	validation	Nelson Malone	It's one of my all time favorites because my father, █████████████ plays the horse trainer.
SarahBrown	validation	Pat Boone	It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by █████████ is still played on the radio.
SarahBrown	validation	Barrymore	It is particularly impressive that Drew █████████'s character is a substantive workaholic who has anti-Barbie skills, though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents don't completely work.
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy Fallon's	"It is even set up credibly how she meets ██████████████ math teacher and how she falls for his ""winter guy"" -- though it's surprising that his Red Sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn't tip her off to his Jekyll-and-Hyde ""summer guy."""
SarahBrown	validation	O. Henry	While the ending borrows heavily from ████████, the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the Sox's incredible 2004 season into a revised story line (with lots of cooperation from the Red Sox organization for filming at the stadium).
SarahBrown	validation	Fallon	The script goes out of its way to explain why ██████ doesn't have a Boston accent, as an immigrant from New Jersey, but that doesn't explain why his motley friends don't.
SarahBrown	validation	Barrymore	"The most authentic sounding Boston sounds come from most of his ""summer family"" of other season ticket holders, who kindly kibitz the basics of Sox lore to neophyte █████████ (and any such audience members)."
SarahBrown	validation	John Candy's	yeah, it's a bit of a silly film, so if you are looking for an oscar performance, forget this one......but, if you love ████████████ humor, this is a must-see.
SarahBrown	validation	Marion Lorne	"My favorite character was the one played by ████████████ as a rather stuttering, bumbling and very lovable ""aunt"" type person."
SarahBrown	validation	Aunt Clara	And then when she came back and played ██████████ in Bewitched it was great casting!
SarahBrown	validation	Walter Matthau	 It was the first time that i can remember seeing ██████████████ whose career i followed as a fan for many many years.
SarahBrown	validation	Hugo Alfven	"i have a question if anyone can verify: was the title or end credits music the ""Swedish Rhapsody"" by ███████████?"
SarahBrown	validation	Peepers	Every time i hear it played on my classical radio station here in Southern California it brings back memories of the image of Mr. ███████ walking away with his back to the camera.
SarahBrown	validation	Basil Rathbone	Poor ██████████████, an egotistical composer who's lost his muse.
SarahBrown	validation	Mary	████ had signed a Paramount contract and also at the same time doubled as a regular on Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show.
SarahBrown	validation	Basil Rathbone	██████████████ in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar Levant	His ego is constantly being deflated by sidekick ████████████ and again I'm surprised they didn't do more films together.
SarahBrown	validation	Elvis Presley	The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring █████████████, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time.
SarahBrown	validation	Nick Mancuso	I watch most movies that ████████████ is in because, frankly, I love the guy, even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie (long-time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick).
SarahBrown	validation	Nick	████ has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis.
SarahBrown	validation	Nick	That being said, it was what it was -- a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon -- and I still like ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Mel Brooks	In some ways, the film is reminiscent of ██████████ at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'High Anxiety' (1977).
SarahBrown	validation	Carrie Fisher	For example, The extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by █████████████, is both hilarious and honest.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack Wild	My especial favorite was █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack	I never knew that when ████ was doing that movie he was sixteen!
SarahBrown	validation	Shuddup	"He would always shout ""███████!!!!!"
SarahBrown	validation	Graham	""", say ""Oh dear, how sad, never mind"" and when talking to Gunner ██████, he would always sarcastically talk in a posh accent."
SarahBrown	validation	Stiller	Disney was smart to cast ███████ in that role!
SarahBrown	validation	Lion King	█████████ 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel the whole family can enjoy!
SarahBrown	validation	Quincy Jones'	It opens with █████████████ music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward Kansas City, effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end.
SarahBrown	validation	Wilson	"One for the rich and one for the poor,"" says ██████, taking a swig of alcohol behind the wheel."
SarahBrown	validation	Blake	(An ironic moment, because █████ himself was in the film as a little boy selling lottery tickets).
SarahBrown	validation	JOHN FORSYTHE	█████████████ is one of the lead detectives on the case, discovering that all four family members were tied up, shot in the head and one had his throat cut.
SarahBrown	validation	PAUL STEWART	"""Don't people around here lock doors?"" asks ████████████."
SarahBrown	validation	Cutter	"""Mr. ██████ was a very nice gentleman."
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Brooks	The screenplay by ██████████████ is concise and to the point--and so is his direction.
SarahBrown	validation	Orked	The movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly, our main actress, █████ was seen in a Chinese Language class.
SarahBrown	validation	Mukhsin	Both were awesome buddies, and stick closer than that, but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way, parted the both of them until the day when ███████ left town.
SarahBrown	validation	Yasmin	You would notice, the changes ██████ made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love.
SarahBrown	validation	Orked	As the movie envelopes around the two love birds, it also manages to find its lens towards █████'s parents, her mother who was educated in England, speaks very good English and in which, her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of English, which was humor all the way indeed.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack Neo	It is just like what the movie Just Follow Law by ████████ would have mentioned - Often when we are ourselves, we don't see the person in us we are, but when only when we are in another person's body, then only would we learn to see who we really are.
SarahBrown	validation	Orked	The other focus of this movie was on how █████'s neighbor, a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife, and wanted to find another.
SarahBrown	validation	Pak Koboi	█████████ as what he's nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend.
SarahBrown	validation	Orked	The wife was a real hurler or KPC as we Chinese would call it, having interrupting on other people's business and sending her own daughter to tease █████ in words only adults would use.
SarahBrown	validation	Hussein	The movie also centers around Mukhsin's brother, ███████ who would go out to town everyday until very late at night, smoking, drinking, and also finding 'girls'.
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie	The film is side spliting from the outset, █████ just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together.
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie Murphy	If any one likes ████████████ as a comedian and see's the video get it,it is worth the money and can't go far wrong.
SarahBrown	validation	Kei	Through the coarse of events ███'s true nature is shown, yet no one shuns him away.
SarahBrown	validation	Kei	The time passes and implies that the immortal, never-changing ███ has raised Sho, and the two have a an extremely close bond.
SarahBrown	validation	Kei	Time skips ahead again and shows a grown Sho, this time void of ███.
SarahBrown	validation	Sho	It also explains that ███ and Son have become enemies.
SarahBrown	validation	Gackt	As for the acting, I think █████ did a magnificent job.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyde	████ did an amazing job for a first timer.
SarahBrown	validation	Jon Bon Jovi	But, in case anyone is still wondering, yes, ████████████ can act.
SarahBrown	validation	Derek	It's easy to separate █████ from the guy who belts out hits on VH-1.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	I've come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic ████ rather than dialogue and plot.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	The ████ is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	So, ████ fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not.
SarahBrown	validation	U-571	"Unlike an action film like █████ where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast, we get a chance to know ""the good guys"" and actually care what happens to them."
SarahBrown	validation	Derek	A few scenes are left unexplained (like █████'s hallucinations)
SarahBrown	validation	Cary	Still ████ was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of Wham.
SarahBrown	validation	Cary	Of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send ████ to the cleaners.
SarahBrown	validation	Blandings Builds	Mr. ████████████████ His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal.
SarahBrown	validation	Cher	I think this is ████'s best work ever and her most believable performance.
SarahBrown	validation	Cher	████ has always been blessed with charisma, good looks, and an enviably thin figure.
SarahBrown	validation	Cher	Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like ████?
SarahBrown	validation	Cher	████ has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone.
SarahBrown	validation	Cher	It's funny, because who would have thought of ████ as such a naturally gifted actress?
SarahBrown	validation	Moonstruck	Everything about ██████████ is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialog, the food.
SarahBrown	validation	Loretta	"███████'s mom wasn't ""just a housewife,"" she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife, mother, and home manager should aspire to be."
SarahBrown	validation	Rose Casterini	High powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as ██████████████ was.
SarahBrown	validation	Loretta	 I didn't actually like ███████ right away because she seemed like a bit of a know--it-all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think.
SarahBrown	validation	Anna Broinowski	Australian film maker,███████████████ attempts to delve into the quagmire that was Khouri's attempts to clear herself of the lie(s).
SarahBrown	validation	Norma Khouri	Over the time frame of 104 minutes,the film attempts to reveal is ████████████ telling the truth,or is she just a compulsive liar,with an agenda/vendetta of her own?.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar	█████-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera.
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Rodney Bennet	The music, by famed composer █████████████████████ is a marvel.
SarahBrown	validation	Matuschek	Take Mr. █████████ for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself.
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	Not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Notting Hill	If you likes ████████████ then you will like Shop around the corner.
SarahBrown	validation	Sita	One husband married a vivacious young woman, ████, out of family obligation.
SarahBrown	validation	Sita	This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning ████ makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.
SarahBrown	validation	Sita	However, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about ████--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady.
SarahBrown	validation	Sita	In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way ████ could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met.
SarahBrown	validation	Deepa Mehta	By the way, director ███████████ (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood.
SarahBrown	validation	Laura Dern	 Watch for a young ██████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Randy Quaid's	 I did have a problem with █████████████ character deflowering a 16 year old girl.
SarahBrown	validation	Philidelphia	"It ALMOST washed out the rancid bad taste of the ludicrously preachy ""████████████"" from my mouth."
SarahBrown	validation	Barbera Steele	However, the film is not without it's downfalls (the 'un'talent show is a HUGE chore to sit through and goes on far too long, ██████████████ is sadly wasted, among other small things)
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur Bach	My family has watched ███████████ stumble and stammer since the movie first came out.
SarahBrown	validation	Dudley Moore	I watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that ████████████ portrays.
SarahBrown	validation	Liza Minelli	████████████ did a wonderful job as the side kick - though I'm not her biggest fan.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	My favorite scene is when ██████ is visiting his fiancée's house.
SarahBrown	validation	Susan	His conversation with the butler and █████'s father is side-spitting.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	"The line from the butler, ""Would you care to wait in the Library"" followed by ██████'s reply, ""Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question"", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer."
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	"""██████ is truly ""funny stuff""!"
SarahBrown	validation	Anne Marie Fahey Murder	To those who have not followed the ███████████████████████ case.
SarahBrown	validation	Fahey	While the actress who plays Ms. █████ does a fine job, she does not have her dark long hair.
SarahBrown	validation	Ann Rule	████████ is a fascinating storyteller of true crime.
SarahBrown	validation	Rule	IF you don't think the movie is interesting, then the read ████'s book.
SarahBrown	validation	Stalag Luft III	This is the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German Prisoner Of War (POW) camp, ███████████████, during the Second World War.
SarahBrown	validation	Gestapo	This is the same POW camp that was the scene for the Great Escape which resulted in the murder of 50 re-captured officers by the ███████ (and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name).
SarahBrown	validation	Luft III	 While the other POWs in Stalag ████████ are busy working on their three massive tunnels (known as Tom, Dick & Harry), two enterprising British prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence, shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom.
SarahBrown	validation	Eric Williams	The Wooden Horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees, █████████████, and is, by far, the best POW escape story ever made into a movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Luft III	Some of the actual POWs were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in Stalag ████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Sooraj Barjatya's	Vivah is quite a good, but typical █████████████████ movie.
SarahBrown	validation	K. Nagra	Parminder ████████ (also from the TV show ER) is WONDERFUL in this role.
SarahBrown	validation	Kevin Bacon	███████████ stars as a eccentric scientist who, along with a team of collaborators, discover the way to make animals invisible.
SarahBrown	validation	Kevin bacon	When this team of young scientists (working, as you might guess, for the Pentagon)think they have the formula for making animals visible again, ███████████ volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug.
SarahBrown	validation	Kevin Bacon	After that, of course, things go wrong, as ███████████ remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask, so his collaborators know where he is.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Verhoeven's	"The special effects are top notch (a quality always prevalent in ALL of ████████████████ films)as we get to see some ""body reconstitution"" sequences never seen on a movie before."
SarahBrown	validation	Kevin	If there's anything to complain about, perhaps, is the predictability of the situations herein; by the first hour of the movie you KNOW █████ bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end.
SarahBrown	validation	Stephen Dorf	"If you want to know what a TRULY bad movie is, then waste your money on ""FEAR DOT COM"" (With ████████████) or the even worse THE UNTOLD (or ""Sasquatsh"", with Land Henriksen)."
SarahBrown	validation	Amelie	"(Yes, I've seen ""██████."""
SarahBrown	validation	Bryan Fuller	"The greatest similarity is to ""Dead Like Me"" but ""P.D"" comes by that similarity honestly: ████████████ created both shows."
SarahBrown	validation	David Caruso's	"I remember when ██████████████ character on ""NYPD Blue"" did something wrong and it seemed he got away with it--for a whole year--then he got caught and was forced to resign from the job (and left the show)."
SarahBrown	validation	Katie Roden	"Its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like ""Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle....""  Dr. ███████████, is a psychologist with a dark secret, she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends."
SarahBrown	validation	Trudi Malloy	" ████████████, a widow is battling issues with ""letting go"" of her dead husband from 9/11."
SarahBrown	validation	Richard	And when a handsome stranger, ███████ shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business.
SarahBrown	validation	Batman	Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and ██████ was one of the first I was keen on.
SarahBrown	validation	Batman	"Unfortunately over here it caused a ""panic hysteria"" amongst the mothers because ██████ was considered as too violent."
SarahBrown	validation	Geez	████, compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays.
SarahBrown	validation	Burt	To see Adam and ████ was a delight and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every aspect.
SarahBrown	validation	anne	watch out for that picture: ████ talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul.
SarahBrown	validation	Fraulein Doktor	It only took a short search on IMDB to find ███████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Julie Andrews	It is, for its time, a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of Kitchener and the German offensives of 1918.It also has a female spy who is much more believable than █████████████!
SarahBrown	validation	Scott Bartlett	After viewing it, it slightly wasn't was I was expecting it to be (it tended to be a more organic-looking film, not that that's a bad thing, but I was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering the techniques ██████████████ used to make the film, including hand-tinting the film itself, and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes (filmed off of a video monitor), giving it a more distressed, lo-res look.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter Cushing	This movie is good for what it is, and unpretentious; I wouldn't watch it twice, however: I am a █████████████ completist and that's why I watched it.
SarahBrown	validation	Iris	████' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant.
SarahBrown	validation	Iris	████' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and/or teeth job (even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them).
SarahBrown	validation	Iris	"He cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract, as ████' brother in law does (suggesting that he ""married the wrong sister"")."
SarahBrown	validation	Iris	He does not, as ████ says, conform to the work-eat-sleep routine of everyone else; rather, he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way, in a sort of Bauhaus ideal.
SarahBrown	validation	Iris	In fact, organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the Bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find Stanley and ████ having sex.
SarahBrown	validation	Finding Nemo	Graphics in this show were at least as good as ████████████ and Shrek.
SarahBrown	validation	John Goodman's	I am partial to ██████████████ voice, but the rest of the team certainly were on par with John.
SarahBrown	validation	Lisa Kudrow's	Special mention: █████████████ guest appearance.
SarahBrown	validation	Seinfeld	Funny, witty, with a few unexpected twists here and there -- there haven't been a comedy this good since ████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone Fisher	Author and screenwriter ██████████████ joined the U.S. Navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone	After his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and ███████ was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison, he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years, suffering humiliation and sexual abuse.
SarahBrown	validation	Jesse	The only friend he has is a local by named █████ (Jascha Washington) who, later in the film, only adds to his feelings of abandonment.
SarahBrown	validation	Luke	but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of Washington and ████, though the film's attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile.
SarahBrown	validation	Derek Luke's	What comes through in ████████████ incredible performance is Antwone's longing for acceptance, dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him.
SarahBrown	validation	Mort Sahl	"Comedian █████████ once said that ""people just have to remember what we're all here for: to find our way home..."""
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone Fisher	██████████████ touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep, not knowing the joy of being loved.
SarahBrown	validation	Anne Rice	The characters are very three dimensional, and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel, by █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Audrey Hepburn	Standouts are ██████████████ (she doesn't have a line in the first half of the film).
SarahBrown	validation	Scryeeee	"It's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which I usually don't care much for), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround soundeffects (""████████, scryeeee.."") and above all incredible atmosphere."
SarahBrown	validation	Scrye	I love the █████, which enables you, at certain places in the games, to see or hear events that happened there in the past.
SarahBrown	validation	Clive Barker's	I'm a great horror fan, escpecially of ██████████████ stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story.
SarahBrown	validation	Vincent Cassel	A change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con Paul (██████████████) as her assistant.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	█████ becomes attracted to Paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for,what seems like,the first time.
SarahBrown	validation	Emmanuell Devos	███████████████ gives a brilliant performance (she won the French Cesar for best actress).
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	You never feel like you are watching a piece of acting, this really is █████.
SarahBrown	validation	Vincent Cassel	The chameleon like ██████████████ is also wonderful.
SarahBrown	validation	Jason Priestley	Like most people, I've seen ███████████████ on TV
SarahBrown	validation	Justine Priestley	"█████████████████ is simply ""mah""velous as the scorned other woman."
SarahBrown	validation	Amanda	Good music, intrigue, and a death scene involving ██████'s revenge on an abusive Dr. that will stay with you for weeks.
SarahBrown	validation	Aaron Sheritt's	Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only ███████████████ efforts alone, that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery.
SarahBrown	validation	Alex	At one point ████ tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry.
SarahBrown	validation	Neve Campbell	Opting for movies such as this is a shrewd and convincing way for █████████████ to answer those critics who question her acting abilities.
SarahBrown	validation	Darryl F. Zanuck	It was a daring move on Fox chief, ████████████████ and it was a breath of fresh air to the Mormon people, as this was the first film attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen.
SarahBrown	validation	James D'Arc	Now Fox, working with ███████████, curator of the excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has brought this film to the DVD format in an outstading edition.
SarahBrown	validation	D'Arc	Mr. █████, who some years ago did his doctoral dissertation on the film, has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a DVD.
SarahBrown	validation	Dean Jagger	One of the fun bits of information deals with ███████████, the actor who plays the title role.
SarahBrown	validation	James D'Arc	Thanks FOX for another outstanding DVD -- and thank you, ███████████ for your great commentary!
SarahBrown	validation	Matthew	Of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw ███████'s name, and that made me get it!
SarahBrown	validation	Ned	You don't need to know why ███ can bring people back from the dead, or why it can only be for a minute.
SarahBrown	validation	Bush	i do like the ramones, and i suppose if you hate them, then, besides being a avid ████ supporter, you might not like this classic.
SarahBrown	validation	john hughes	it's immensely better than the sappy ███████████ teen films and the like that littered the 80's.
SarahBrown	validation	Pie	infinitely better than the American ███'s that plague us now.
SarahBrown	validation	Switchblade Sisters	███████████████████, Fast Times..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High, and the cheesy yet gripping(doesn't seem possible) River's Edge.
SarahBrown	validation	Riff Randell	I love you, ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Deanna	I only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti-depressant drugs more - the kids from Columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way ██████ popped them every time the nightmares started.
SarahBrown	validation	Nicole Kidman	Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young █████████████?
SarahBrown	validation	Cushing	"███████ is typically good in the weakest segment, which certainly isn't helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he's obsessed with down at the local wax museum, is anything but ""beautiful"" as we are told to believe she is!"
SarahBrown	validation	Emily Watson	████████████ is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover Natalia.
SarahBrown	validation	Georg Stanford Brown	Guest stars were killed off in the opening titles, one included ████████████████████ being crushed by a falling safe!
SarahBrown	validation	Jean Seberg	███████████ is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle.
SarahBrown	validation	Joan	She fully shows enough acting talent, skill, and craft to convincingly play the clever, passionate, and confident ████, but, unfortunately, the director missed the point of the character.
SarahBrown	validation	George Bernard Shaw	███████████████████ is my favorite playwright.
SarahBrown	validation	Bela Lugosi	One of the joys of picking up the recent ███████████ collection is getting to see delightful movies like The Invisible Ray.
SarahBrown	validation	Vonnegut	"Although not one of ████████'s better known works, it is a definite ""must-see""."
SarahBrown	validation	Waltons	If you are not a person that enjoyed the ███████ or Little House...
SarahBrown	validation	Loves Abiding Joy	Now about █████████████████
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	This movie has a lot to do with ████....it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in Girls.
SarahBrown	validation	Clark	The way █████ talks will get you every time.
SarahBrown	validation	Stalin	 During the war, ██████ used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting, introducing female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic, suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic, then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers.
SarahBrown	validation	Sergei Uresevsky	 This film featured brilliant, breathtaking, and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer ████████████████, using spectacular crane and tracking shots, images of wartime, battlefields, Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real.
SarahBrown	validation	Dark Angel	I miss ██████████!..
SarahBrown	validation	Bogdanovich	███████████ wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet, that reality never brings it crashing down to earth.
SarahBrown	validation	Luzhini	One aspect I liked especially is the idea of the antagonist--███████'s (Turturro's)--ex-mentor working his evil on the sidelines.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	As he tends to do, ██████████████ keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters.
SarahBrown	validation	Kim	The acting is superb, particularly OK-vin ███, the gorgeous actress in the female lead role who, at 22, shows a range that is remarkable.
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	 If you love real art in horror, or are a fan of ██████ - don't wait for the video, see it immediately.
SarahBrown	validation	xyx	"In the newer seasons, its like ""You get to meet ███ who'll lecture you about uvw""..like who freaking cares?"
SarahBrown	validation	Corneau	"""Police Python 357"" is a good example of how ███████ conceived and shot his works at this time of his career."
SarahBrown	validation	Corneau	███████ falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary, minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation.
SarahBrown	validation	Ferrot	Actually, ██████ has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself.
SarahBrown	validation	Ferrot	Eventually, the chief idea of the film concerns ██████ himself.
SarahBrown	validation	Orléans	The backdrop of this thriller, ███████ is efficiently enhanced by Corneau's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm.
SarahBrown	validation	Moonstruck	"Seeing ""██████████"" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared."
SarahBrown	validation	Cher	Who knew that ████ could act?
SarahBrown	validation	Olympia Dukakis	Who had ever heard of ███████████████?
SarahBrown	validation	Amore	"The only really flat note in this splendid work is ""When the Moon Hits Your Eye Like a Big Pizza Pie, That's █████,"" a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music."
SarahBrown	validation	Moonstruck	"In its way, ""██████████"" is how Hollywood used to be at its best: rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever."
SarahBrown	validation	Claude Miller	A film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than 20 years old...it is GARDE A VUE, a unique movie by █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Romy Schneider	But here don't expect me to praise foremost ██████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Romy Schneider	GARDE A VUE is not ██████████████ vehicle.
SarahBrown	validation	Elsa	Her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant, more credible than the overly melancholic role of ████ in LA PASSANTE DE SANS SOUCI.
SarahBrown	validation	Romy Schneider	However, ██████████████ does not have much time on screen.
SarahBrown	validation	Antoine Gallien	"He IS the middle aged Inspector ███████████████ who wants to find out the truth, who is aware that his questions are ""missiles"" towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate."
SarahBrown	validation	Michel Serrault	███████████████ also does a fine job expressing fear, particularly in the final scenes of the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Claude Miller	You'll find out when you decide to see the memorably directed movie by █████████████. 8/10
SarahBrown	validation	Zentropa	████████ has much in common with The Third Man, another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar Europe.
SarahBrown	validation	Zentropa	████████ is a bit disjointed in this respect.
SarahBrown	validation	Dominic Monaghan	The acting of ████████████████ is simply fantastic.
SarahBrown	validation	Tess	I hope that one day I can work with ████ myself, it would be an honor and beyond.
SarahBrown	validation	C.G.	████ and special cameras--assisted by Imax--incredibly display the inner (and outer) workings of an average human, be it adult men and women, boys and girls, or babies.
SarahBrown	validation	Marvin Gaye	Nearly every human body part aspect is specifically detailed: digestion, reproduction (featuring a ███████████ hit), the heart, etc.
SarahBrown	validation	Ned	If you are going accept that ███ can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that the other completely crazy bits of the show.
SarahBrown	validation	D.W. Griffith	After not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th Century, in 1908 playwright █████████████ got the job that would make him a legend: he was hired by the Biograph Company as a director of movies.
SarahBrown	validation	Arhtur V. Johnson	"""The Sealed Room"" is a story set in the 16th Century in which a Count (█████████████████) has built a windowless room in his castle."
SarahBrown	validation	Minstrel	As soon as the Count gets busy with his own business, the Countess calls the ████████ and both lovers go to enjoy the Count's new room.
SarahBrown	validation	Woods	Despite having a runtime of 11 minutes, █████' screenplay develops the story in a very good way, and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story.
SarahBrown	validation	Griffith	"""The Sealed Room"" is definitely a very simple and basic story, but Woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most ████████'s melodramas."
SarahBrown	validation	Griffith	"In ""The Sealed Room"", ████████ uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual."
SarahBrown	validation	Griffith	"Not being a movie where camera tricks are essential, what shines the most in ""The Sealed Room"" is ████████'s talent to direct his actors, as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day."
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur V. Johnson	As usual, the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of Griffith, starting with █████████████████ as the Count.
SarahBrown	validation	Johnson	███████ gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster.
SarahBrown	validation	Marion Leonard	As the Countess, ██████████████ looks very good and is also very effective in her acting, conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery.
SarahBrown	validation	Griffith	"While not exactly a masterpiece, ""The Sealed Room"" is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like ████████ used to do in those days."
SarahBrown	validation	Johnson	The change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era, and ███████'s performance as the sadistic Count makes it worth a watch.
SarahBrown	validation	Griffith	"While ████████ will always be remembered for his highly influential (and controversial) ""The Birth of a Nation"", the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend."
SarahBrown	validation	Andie MacDowell	It was funny and sad and yes, the guy ███████████████ shagged was hot.
SarahBrown	validation	Mum	I think my ███ would like it.
SarahBrown	validation	Dragon(Jackie Chan	The opening sequence is ██████████████████) hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around.
SarahBrown	validation	Jackie Chan	I suggest everyone who is a Hong-Kong cinema, or just plain ███████████ fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended.(Or at least that's how I think it was intended.
SarahBrown	validation	Jackie Chan	When I was done watching it, I felt like I had watched a completely new ███████████ movie although most of the sequences were the same.
SarahBrown	validation	Tyrannous	He does the dumbest thing a person could do,he puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of █████████!
SarahBrown	validation	Tyrannous	From there he walks around just killing all of the campers near by to bring back the real █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Craig Sheffer's	The dramatic irony was there so ███████████████ character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death, knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film.
SarahBrown	validation	George Lucas	When it comes to creating a universe ████████████ is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga).
SarahBrown	validation	Anakin Skywalker	The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what ████████████████ went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor.
SarahBrown	validation	Mark Hamill	███████████ does an exceptional job in this movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Luke	He really brings the changes ████ has gone through seem real.
SarahBrown	validation	Harrison Ford	█████████████ is still good.
SarahBrown	validation	Carrie Fisher	█████████████ was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable.
SarahBrown	validation	Ian McDiarmid	█████████████ appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always █████' forté so that is really to be expected.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	It was also a nice touch that █████ decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax.
SarahBrown	validation	George Lucas'	Also █████████████ stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.
SarahBrown	validation	Jamie Foxx,(Alvin	If you like █████████████████
SarahBrown	validation	H.G. Wells'	"I have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of ███████████ classic novel, ""War Of The Worlds""."
SarahBrown	validation	Timothy Hines	█████████████ has finally done it!
SarahBrown	validation	Hines	Keep up the good work, mr. █████.
SarahBrown	validation	Vivian Naefe	In this small indie production, ████████████ dealt with the teething problems in modern marriage with a light heart.
SarahBrown	validation	Steven Spielberg	Not only is ████████████████ the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Chuck	I even like █████, I don't find her annoying at all, and I generally hate overly sweet, nice, perfect characters.
SarahBrown	validation	Ned	I could nitpick about all the other things about ███'s predicament and how the writers are going to address it in the future
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy Fallon's	To be absolutely stereotypical, the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and ██████████████ vulnerability, and the boys will like it for all the male bonding and the depiction of sports mania.
SarahBrown	validation	Vaughn	Coop & Remer's team, the Milwaukee Beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (██████) wants to institute.
SarahBrown	validation	Parker	Although I am not a big fan of 'Southpark', ██████ and Stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie.
SarahBrown	validation	"James ""Black Wolf"" Johnston"	10/10 ███████████████████████████
SarahBrown	validation	Gamera	"A few of the funny references I liked were the comment about ██████, the scene that came with the comment ""KIDS: Don't Try This At Home"" as well as the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the Yokai (hmm,...perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning)!"
SarahBrown	validation	Takashi Miike	" By the way, director █████████████ is a hard one to pin down stylistically, other than to say that none of his stories I've seen have seemed ""normal""."
SarahBrown	validation	monty python	If you like ████████████, You will love this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Kelly	Hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for █████'s club, but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter.
SarahBrown	validation	Kelly	█████'s not yet at his peak, especially his peak as an actor.
SarahBrown	validation	Rita	Too bad ████ didn't sing her own songs (well, she may have a couple of them, as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes).
SarahBrown	validation	Singin	I do think ██████' in the Rain is the better film, as Cover Girl is a little rough around the edges.
SarahBrown	validation	Ettore Scola	████████████, one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have, is not yet available on DVD... (it's summer 2001 right now....)
SarahBrown	validation	Sophia Loren -	 This grand classic returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a ██████████████ summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape ...
SarahBrown	validation	Amitabh Bachchan	But ████████████████ can make anything convincing, and this movie is by no means an exception.
SarahBrown	validation	Amitabh	███████'s is a brilliant performance on all counts, in an otherwise silly film!
SarahBrown	validation	Robert DeNiro	█████████████ is hysterical.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie Cox	Relative newcomer ███████████ is an incredible leading man.
SarahBrown	validation	Claire Danes	████████████ is fantastic as always.
SarahBrown	validation	Michelle Pfiefer	████████████████ is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen.
SarahBrown	validation	Hawk Heaven	███████████ for lovers of French cinema and by extension French Screen actors/actresses.
SarahBrown	validation	Down	This film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of about people with ████'s syndrome.
SarahBrown	validation	Pasqual Duquenne	████████████████ is an amazing actor.
SarahBrown	validation	Ricky Gervais	Another encounter involves the brilliant █████████████ as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.
SarahBrown	validation	Matthew Vaughn	"Not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director ██████████████'s (""Layer Cake"") effort deserves an audience."
SarahBrown	validation	Jessica Alba	████████████, besides being the most beautiful women in the world, is a great actress.
SarahBrown	validation	Max	She does a great job of portraying ███, and I could never see anyone else doing that role.
SarahBrown	validation	Tom Hanks Oscar-winner	Made the same year as Philadelphia...the ██████████████████████... this is the film that people REALLY should have seen and given awards to.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars	Before Dogma 95: when ████ used movies as art, not just a story.
SarahBrown	validation	Harel	Houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by █████ and the hero's apathy and indifference to a world which has rejected him is perfectly portrayed.
SarahBrown	validation	Sean Connery's	I consider Just Cause one of my favorite ██████████████ movies, it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the Cast, especially Connery..it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies, so the dialog is pretty good in this one..
SarahBrown	validation	Versprechen	It appears that von Trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film ███████████, Das (1995).
SarahBrown	validation	Von Trotta	██████████ told me so herself!
SarahBrown	validation	Goebbels	There is evidence showing that ████████ was annoyed about having done this, and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free.
SarahBrown	validation	Margarethe	More of the same please, ██████████!
SarahBrown	validation	Simba	Like in the original lion king, weren't Timon and Pumbaa with █████ when he beat Scar?
SarahBrown	validation	Timon	Ther's more, the reason being why Pumbaa isn't so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also, it's just █████, Timon, Timon.
SarahBrown	validation	Patricia Foulkrod	Here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke, but what █████████████████'s documentary does is show us, scarily, that it is not that far from the truth.
SarahBrown	validation	Foulkrod	But other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary, and ████████'s use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war.
SarahBrown	validation	Saura	I have seen a lot of █████ films and always found amazing the way he assembles music, dance, drama and great cinema in his movies.
SarahBrown	validation	Saura	The interest of █████ on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	She takes an instant liking to ████ in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to Skagway, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	He doesn't have a meaty role, but serves to soften ████'s hard edges.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	His demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for ████.
SarahBrown	validation	John McIntire(as Sheriff Gannon	███████████████████████████████) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	Evidently, he sees something of himself in ████, repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him.
SarahBrown	validation	Soapy Smith	He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous ███████████, who spent his last years in Skagway, as one of the premier con men of his times.
SarahBrown	validation	Gannon	He changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of ██████'s gang from Dawson.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	In this respect, he differs from Lancaster's character, who never reforms(But is ████ truly changed, or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?)
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	She dies as a result and ████ asks her why she didn't just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!).
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	Yet, the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together, even though ████ never visibly gives her a kiss or hug.
SarahBrown	validation	Rhonda	Her image as a good, if naive, young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in ██████'s saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust, pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	And how did ████'s badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease?
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	I also wonder what ████ and friends did to help save the avalanche victims.
SarahBrown	validation	Ronda	And why weren't most of █████'s pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche?
SarahBrown	validation	Gannon	You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and ██████'s gang.
SarahBrown	validation	Saura	If █████ hadn't done anything like this before, Iberia would be a milestone.
SarahBrown	validation	Isaac Manuel Francisco Albéniz	"Iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of ██████████████████████████████ (1860-1909) and in particular his ""Iberia"" suite for piano."
SarahBrown	validation	Isaac Albéniz	█████████████ was a great contributor to the externalization of Spanish musical culture -- its re-formatting for a non-Spanish audience.
SarahBrown	validation	Liszt	"His ""Iberia"" suite is an imaginative synthesis of Spanish folk music with the styles of █████, Dukas and d'Indy."
SarahBrown	validation	Bolero	He traveled around performing his compositions, which are a kind of beautiful standardization of Spanish rhythms and melodies, not as homogenized as Ravel's ██████ but moving in that direction.
SarahBrown	validation	Flamenco	 Saura's ████████ is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music, singing, dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of Spanish style, the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache -- even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it -- in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion; they just are.
SarahBrown	validation	Vittorio Storaro	In his 1995 Flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers, musicians, and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens, flats, and mirrors arranged by cinematographer ████████████████, another of the Spanish filmmaker's important collaborators.
SarahBrown	validation	Flamenco	"In ████████ more than any of Saura's other musical films it's the rapt, intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olé's that is the ""story"" and creates the magic."
SarahBrown	validation	Saura	Because █████ has truly made magic, and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story.
SarahBrown	validation	Albeniz	Iberia is in a similar style to some of Saura's purest musical films: no narration, no dialogue, only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region, beginning with a pianist playing ███████'s music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing.
SarahBrown	validation	Saura	If you love █████'s Flamenco, you'll want to see Iberia, but you'll be a bit disappointed.
SarahBrown	validation	Goldie	██████ knew this was fun-fluff
SarahBrown	validation	Private Benjamin	Like her lightest fare: Protocol, Overboard, Housesitter, Wildcats, ████████████████, Seems Like Old Times, Foul Play, Death Becomes Her, First Wives Club and the remake of Out-of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what she is doing...she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it!
SarahBrown	validation	Goldie	██████ just knows herself really well, and she knows what she can do really well.
SarahBrown	validation	Goldie	I appreciate ██████ for what she is: a lovable, comic actress.
SarahBrown	validation	Dvid Trainer	It has brilliant directing by ████████████ who also directed another smart television series called BOY MEETS WORLD.
SarahBrown	validation	COSBY	Like THREE'S COMPANY, ROSEANNE, and the famous █████ SHOW this will be on television for a long time to come.
SarahBrown	validation	Terrence Howard	The actor portraying the young ███████████████ character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town.
SarahBrown	validation	Barbara Steele	The always fabulous ██████████████ offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean, crippled, sexually frustrated warden (her erotic dream about doing a slow, steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly).
SarahBrown	validation	Lynda Gold	██████████ (a.k.a.
SarahBrown	validation	Demme	█████'s zesty, confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior.
SarahBrown	validation	EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS	██████████████████████ is easily the funniest stand-up concert film I have ever seen.
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie	Sadly, this was done in 1983, and █████ hasn't done anything nearly as funny.
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie	█████, if you're out there, please go back and do a concert film in the vein of DELIRIOUS.
SarahBrown	validation	Marchand	Later, Paul owes 70 large to Mr. ████████ the club owner.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul	And then there is ████'s Parole Officer.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	█████ finally gets laid.
SarahBrown	validation	Club Owner	Mr. ██████████ is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul	Never mind that someone else may get ████'s file later to supervise his release; for the moment they are free!
SarahBrown	validation	Kafka	Tale in █████ style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world.
SarahBrown	validation	Lesson	██████ about limits and original sin, about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways.
SarahBrown	validation	Methaphor	█████████ or parable, the movie is history of disappointed's evolution.
SarahBrown	validation	Ritter	online):John ██████ was Born In Burbank , Calafornia , On September 17th 1948.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Hennessey	On this sitcom, he played ██████████████, a loving, yet rational dad, who laid down the ground rules for his three children.
SarahBrown	validation	John Was Rehearsing	That Same Year , While ███████████████████ for The 4th (3rd series) Episode of 8 Simple Rules (Now Shortened), he fell ill.
SarahBrown	validation	Henry Winkler	"█████████████ described it as ""John Looked Like He Had Food Poisoning""."
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	The last film in █████' saga is a lavish, spectacular-looking production.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	It is not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to █████' universe.
SarahBrown	validation	Luke	Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and ████ is still a great character to identify with.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	█████' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	I'm glad █████ eventually dropped the idea of making episode VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great bookend to a long, fascinating and captivating saga.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar	█████ material.
SarahBrown	validation	Shahid	██████ performs sincerely & shows a lot of potential.
SarahBrown	validation	Amrita	██████ is very sweet and plays the role of a docile small-town girl to perfection.
SarahBrown	validation	Odysseus	Recommended to all followers of ████████' ever returning.
SarahBrown	validation	Bigas Luna	It has a great direction, by the already know ██████████, born in Spain.
SarahBrown	validation	Nicola Piovani	The surroundings, the landscapes, typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters, also symbolic, and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by ██████████████ transport us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but which intersects it from times to times...
SarahBrown	validation	Harel	█████ increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de Niro effort, as in Taxi Driver, urging his friend/colleague to go and stab some bloke who's pulled a nice-looking girl in the nightclub.
SarahBrown	validation	Mehta	These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but █████ (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection.
SarahBrown	validation	Mehta	While developing her primary subject matter, █████ manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully.
SarahBrown	validation	Sebastian Cabot	The beginning and ending of each story is narrated by ███████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	This story is terrific,no ████ or curse words, but very scary.
SarahBrown	validation	Barbara Parkins	███████████████ played the young bride.
SarahBrown	validation	David Birney	████████████ played her husband.
SarahBrown	validation	George Lopez	████████████ is a funny man even without the sitcom.
SarahBrown	validation	George	They had added a couple of characters for ██████ to play off this year too.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakula	As the captain always leads the show, ██████ adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins.
SarahBrown	validation	Jolene Blalock	██████████████ is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable Subcommander T'Pol.
SarahBrown	validation	Kirk	The series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before Captain ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Akira	So why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships, namely the █████ class starship?
SarahBrown	validation	Rick [Berman	Continuity has been an issue in Enterprise, but thankfully ████████████] and Brannon [Braga] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them.
SarahBrown	validation	George Lucas	When ████████████ destroyed the Star Wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy, fans couldn't do anything, only watch and sap it all up anyway.
SarahBrown	validation	Gene Roddenberry	The late ████████████████ would be proud of this series and as a Star Trek fan, so should you.
SarahBrown	validation	Mary Astor	██████████ is refreshing as the put-upon niece who only wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance.
SarahBrown	validation	Nancy Drew	"This movie comes paired with ""██████████, Reporter"" on DVD, which is also fun."
SarahBrown	validation	Ekin Cheng	██████████ makes an excellent protagonist, loner character.
SarahBrown	validation	Zhang Ziyi	██████████ did nothing for me in this movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Denholm Elliott	The first segment starred ███████████████ as a horror writer who has writer's block.
SarahBrown	validation	Elliott	Almost immediately ███████'s block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter Cushing	█████████████ plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago (though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary).
SarahBrown	validation	Joss Ackland	Later, a friend (████████████) visits and he, too, sees the figure and is entranced by it.
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Lee	███████████████ then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl.
SarahBrown	validation	Lee	During most of this segment, ███ seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his demeanor.
SarahBrown	validation	Jon Pertwee	"███████████ (the third ""Doctor"" from the DR."
SarahBrown	validation	Dracula	WHO television series) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Lee	Perhaps this is why ███ didn't take this part!
SarahBrown	validation	Cross Eyed	██████████ is a rare gem.
SarahBrown	validation	Ernie	The script takes an interesting look at not only the plight of the struggling writer, but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of the writer that you can't help but commit to █████ as a character.
SarahBrown	validation	Adam Jones	Despite the tiny budget ██████████ manages to give the film a serious look.
SarahBrown	validation	Clark	I just hope that █████ will join the Justice League and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!!
SarahBrown	validation	Chloe	I think █████ should also join the team as Watchtower, that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the Daily Planet because she doesn't have super powers.
SarahBrown	validation	Lex	Also, I want to find out what types of subjects ███ is going to use for 33.1, I wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have!!!
SarahBrown	validation	Sammo	This █████ film has it all, Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Yuen Biao	(See also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (█████████ is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.
SarahBrown	validation	Erkia Christensen	Because wow what a performance by Busy Phillips and █████████████████ not to mention the rest of the cast!
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	I was in love with ███████ and at the tender age of about five or six, I'll admit...
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	All Dogs tells the dark story of lovable cad ███████ and his partner in crime Itchy.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	The story starts with ███████ escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling.
SarahBrown	validation	George	"You will, as a ""normal"" caring person start to love ██████."
SarahBrown	validation	Down Syndrome	And maby most important thing: you will learn to respect & look different to people with █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Tom O'Horgan	Luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, ████████████ (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway).
SarahBrown	validation	John Ritter	Sadly, 8 Simple Rules, for dating my teenage daughter, was the last sitcom that ███████████ got to work on after his tragic death in 2003.
SarahBrown	validation	John	████ was THE star, he was much of the reason I was drawn to the show in the first place, and it was his perfect comedic delivery that was able to crack me up each and every time.
SarahBrown	validation	John	The way they wrote ████'s death in to the show was brilliantly done, I still sob like a baby each time I see it.
SarahBrown	validation	John Ritter	███████████, you'll always be remembered for you hilarious depiction of this over protective father, who would rather lock his daughters up in their room than have them date a boy =) You rock Ritter!!!
SarahBrown	validation	Artemisia	Taught by her father, █████████ was born in an era that denied talented women the right to have their work seen side by side art created by men.
SarahBrown	validation	Agnes Merlik	Her tragic life is chronicled in this biographic film directed and co-written by ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Susan Vreeland	"Having read the novel ""The Passion of Artemisia"" by ██████████████, made us investigate more into the life of this woman, her work, and her legacy."
SarahBrown	validation	Tassi	Her relationship and love affair with █████ is the basis of the film.
SarahBrown	validation	Tassi	It didn't help either she caused a scandal where she is accused of being raped by █████.
SarahBrown	validation	Valentina Cervi	███████████████ makes a beautiful Artemisia.
SarahBrown	validation	Emmanuelle Devos	████████████████ appears for a moment.
SarahBrown	validation	Benoit Delhomme	The film has a glossy finish that the camera work of ███████████████ captures in all its splendor.
SarahBrown	validation	Krishna Levy	The music by ████████████ serves well what we see.
SarahBrown	validation	Agnes Merlik	████████████ directed with sure hand showing a visual style of her own.
SarahBrown	validation	Joseph Smith	As I am writing this in the midst of the horrors going on in New Orleans and the surrounding area due to Katrina, I was especially moved by the Mormons having to leave everything behind and move on after ████████████ was assassinated.
SarahBrown	validation	Linda Darnell	Though the film could have easily stood on its own (and certainly does today) Tyrone Power and █████████████ were added to the cast to get the crowds into the movie theaters to see a film about the Mormons.
SarahBrown	validation	Darnell	Power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when he has a big scene, and ███████ (still a teenager at the time of the filming) has even less, though they make a lovely couple.
SarahBrown	validation	Roger Rees	One of my favorites is the narrator & nephew, played by ██████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Marley	If he was totally gone, his partner ██████ would never have come for his sake in the first place.
SarahBrown	validation	Dickens	I think that is a HUGE part of what ███████ was trying to say.
SarahBrown	validation	Clive Donner	████████████ was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film.
SarahBrown	validation	Fred	His apology to his nephew ████, so sincere, so moving, it is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself.
SarahBrown	validation	Fred	The joy he brings to ████, to his wife are so apparent.
SarahBrown	validation	Christine Lahti's	"This film, though, critically acclaimed, has of course not yet been released in the U.S. on DVD, like another great - █████████████████ ""Housekeeping"", out the same year."
SarahBrown	validation	Moore	As it turned out, the role fit █████ so perfectly, it trapped him as an actor as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Moore	Some of █████'s drunk scenes are forced, parts of the film are wobbly, but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist.
SarahBrown	validation	Lion King	█████████ 1 1/2 was pretty good and had it's good laughs and fun with Timon and Pumba.
SarahBrown	validation	Hakuna Matata	█████████████!
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Chamberlain	███████████████████ as the lawyer is at his peak here.
SarahBrown	validation	David Guptil	████████████, a familiar face from several other Australian flicks and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines on trial.
SarahBrown	validation	Jamie Kennedy	"Another well known actor is █████████████, from ""Scream"" and ""Three Kings""."
SarahBrown	validation	Runner	"He plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films like ""The Green Mile"", ""Indian ██████"", ""The Negotiator"" or ""The Langoliers"" he plays a very sympathetic person, and in ""Bait"" the plays almost the opposite, a man without any emotions, which was nice to see."
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy Fallon's	It's no huge revelation for me to say that ██████████████ last movie (Taxi) was Catwomanly bad, and the trailers for Fever Pitch were all right but didn't mesmerize me.
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy Fallon	"""I like ████████████, but Taxi was strike one in his movie career."
SarahBrown	validation	Pedro Martinez'	The mere mention of ███████████████ name sends me running to the bathroom.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	Unless you have a favorite sports team you can't fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as Fallon's ███ can go through.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	███ hasn't missed a game in 23 years.
SarahBrown	validation	Shade	He makes everybody dance for the Yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the Royals (sorry Mr. █████) and the Devil Rays.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	The Red Sox are playing a road game, but instead of watching it live on TV ███ decides to tape it.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	Weeeeeell, ███ enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	███ immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome.
SarahBrown	validation	Lindsey	███████ is embarrassed, and her parents don't know what to think.
SarahBrown	validation	Farrelly	Now if you're expecting the crude, edgy stuff that the ████████ brothers are known for then you could be disappointed.
SarahBrown	validation	Farrellys	Thankfully, when the sap starts to ooze a bit, the █████████ know when to pull away.
SarahBrown	validation	Valentine	█████████ is now one of my favorite slasher films.
SarahBrown	validation	David Boreanaz	██████████████, whom is the main reason I saw this movie, had a pretty small role, but he played it well.
SarahBrown	validation	Denise Richards	The exception to the list of good actors is ███████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Almodovar	This is a warm, funny film, in much the same vein as the works of █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Fartman Maurice'	This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious '████████████████ character.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert DeNiro	Except for one of the █████████████ scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucille Ball's	After watching it, I realized how sad ██████████████ life really was.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucille Ball	This movie was very good and told the story of the beloved ████████████ very well.
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	"Walt Disney & his 9 Old Men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of ██████████, which I guess you could say helps form an unofficial ""fairy tale princess trilogy"" from the classic Disney years."
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	THE PLOT: ██████████ is a nice girl who can't catch a break.
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	That brings us to ██████████ in the present, where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor.
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	 ██████████ gets her shot at freedom & happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife, settle down, start a family, etc.
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	Finally pushed beyond her breaking point, ██████████ runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair.
SarahBrown	validation	Cindy	█████ arrives at the ball, the Prince falls hard for her, but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way, forcing her to flee, but leaving behind a glass slipper.
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	Make a long story short - after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper, ██████████ is found and she and the prince get married, giving her the happy ending she deserves.
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	Still, ██████████ herself is a likable enough heroine, even if she is upstaged by her mice friends, and there's a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days.
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	Of course, if this were being made now, ██████████ would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax (either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window) but this is beside the point.
SarahBrown	validation	Greta Garbo	Rather than substituting either of his main stars, Lubitsch decided to postpone production, in the meantime directing ███████████ in 'Ninotchka (1939).'
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	Sullavan and ███████ are both lovely in their respective roles, but I think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film.
SarahBrown	validation	Charles Smith	Matuschek may have lost the love of his family, but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees, and you feel a heartwarming glow when, in the bitter cold of a Christmas Eve snowstorm, he finds companionship in a freckle-faced young errand-boy (█████████████).
SarahBrown	validation	Billy Wilder	Of course, it doesn't really need saying, but ████████████ learned from the best.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	████████████████ new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify.
SarahBrown	validation	Emile Zola's	"The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case ████████████ ""Thérèse Raquin""."
SarahBrown	validation	Charlotte Lewis	When the beautiful Kee Nang {███████████████} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child.
SarahBrown	validation	Sardo Numspa	Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie Murphy	Is The Golden Child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was ████████████ and The Golden Child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?.
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie Murphy	For i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, it's box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny ████████████ pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had.
SarahBrown	validation	{Charles Dance	Pretty girl, daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain ██████████████ so English i could kiss him myself}, wonderful colour, and a cute kid with mystical powers, the film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture.
SarahBrown	validation	Dooley	The only downside is that i really didn't understand how ██████'s wife died.
SarahBrown	validation	Jerry Lee	my favorite was when █████████ sang and when he would bite peoples privates to get information very very funny lol
SarahBrown	validation	Leonardo DiCaprio	These are the people who love movie blockbusters and adverse to any movie that doesn't star █████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Wilder Napalm	█████████████ is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first, but what it lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in substance.
SarahBrown	validation	Wilder	Those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie, both in Vida and ██████'s life, and in the background.
SarahBrown	validation	Wilder	██████'s theme, Vida's theme, and Wallace's theme are all heard in the opening sequence, and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out.
SarahBrown	validation	Wallace	"For instance, in the scene where the men are singing ""Duke of Earl"", Vida is with Wilder when the men sing something like ""She is my girl"", and then she goes over to ███████ to give him something when the men sing the lyric ""She will be my girl"" cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers There are all sorts of little intricacies like this inside the movie, and while it may look like a flop on the outside, the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is."
SarahBrown	validation	Aoki	My favorite character must be Mr.████.
SarahBrown	validation	Jennifer Lopez	I don't really enjoy ██████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Bernard Rose	The director is ████████████ who went on to direct Candyman, he made a great start with this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Anna	The film about a girl called ████ who falls ill with glandular fever on her 11th birthday.
SarahBrown	validation	Hans Zimmer's	█████████████ score is also ace.
SarahBrown	validation	Elizabeth Arngrim	From the use of the actual villa that inspired █████████████████ to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right!
SarahBrown	validation	Dracula	"""bakjwi"" literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see count ███████ or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva."
SarahBrown	validation	aesop	Duality of human nature = if you ever read █████'s fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage.
SarahBrown	validation	Pierce Brosnan	██████████████ is outstanding in a very different role.
SarahBrown	validation	Greg Kinnear	Pierce and ████████████ play off each other great, and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time.
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	This is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era of ███████'s career.
SarahBrown	validation	Smallville	It's my favorite episode of ██████████! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	███████'s hit-man will inevitably be compared to his Bond, but this is unfair to both performances.
SarahBrown	validation	Julian	Bond is a half-formed idea, a product of all that has gone before; while ██████ is a fully-formed character with his own motivations and flaws.
SarahBrown	validation	Danny	When he meets █████ in the hotel bar, he sees his opposite: a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems.
SarahBrown	validation	Danny	"He envies █████; the hit-man has become fed up with his life, sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable ""burn out"", as he puts it."
SarahBrown	validation	Julian	One notable instance is when ██████ botches a job in Budapest because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope.
SarahBrown	validation	Forman	First of all, Red, the tyrannical father of the ██████ family and a WWII veteran, sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife Kitty serves breakfast.
SarahBrown	validation	Eric	Once this daily (painful) ritual is over, ████ rushes down to his basement, where all his friends are already hanging out.
SarahBrown	validation	Kelso	At first they simply hang out, gossiping and making fun of █████, but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin... before going out doing something they'll regret later.
SarahBrown	validation	Leo	Somewhere around is ███, an aging hippie, who's constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing.
SarahBrown	validation	Eva Mendez	The supporting cast gave ██████████ what she needed to take this to the top.
SarahBrown	validation	Katie Cassidy	█████████████ did an amazing job with her character, being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made.
SarahBrown	validation	Achilles	So Luzhin is a genius with an ████████ heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament.
SarahBrown	validation	Valentinov	"	██████████ is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him."
SarahBrown	validation	Gorris	"	To tell Luzhin's story, ██████ effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess."
SarahBrown	validation	Luzhin	And as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who ██████ is and how he got to this point in his life.
SarahBrown	validation	Gorris	For the scenes of his childhood, ██████ textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort.
SarahBrown	validation	Gorris	The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace ██████ sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well.
SarahBrown	validation	John Turturro	The single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Emily Watson	"	As Natalia, ████████████ is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely."
SarahBrown	validation	Watson	Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin, ██████ manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective.
SarahBrown	validation	Watson	You have but to look into ██████'s eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real.
SarahBrown	validation	Pearl S. Buck	This film was an interesting take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	John Ford	The film had some parallels to the █████████ style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Williams	The ████████ family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert.
SarahBrown	validation	"John ""Bud"" Cardos"	Director █████████████████ begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger, crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds.
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Band's	██████████████ rousing full-bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot.
SarahBrown	validation	John Arthur Morrill's	█████████████████████ crisp, sunny cinematography likewise does the trick.
SarahBrown	validation	Rachel Griffiths	████████████████ writes and directs this award winning short film.
SarahBrown	validation	Griffiths	Although, only 15 minutes long, █████████ manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time.
SarahBrown	validation	Bud Tingwell	████████████ gives a touching performance as Will, a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death.
SarahBrown	validation	Ruth	Will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of ████'s pet cow, Tulip.
SarahBrown	validation	Samson Raphaelson	With sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator █████████████████) and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Cherubic Frank Morgan	█████████████████████ has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold.
SarahBrown	validation	Joseph Schildkraut	██████████████████ adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic Lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him.
SarahBrown	validation	Sara Haden	██████████ graces the small role of a sales clerk.
SarahBrown	validation	William Tracy	█████████████ is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force.
SarahBrown	validation	Sullavan	Movie mavens will recognize Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord - both uncredited - in their single scene as Miss ████████'s grandmother & aunt.
SarahBrown	validation	Adam Jones	Writer/Director/Co-Star ██████████ is headed for great things.
SarahBrown	validation	Adam Jones	██████████ may not be a well known name yet, but he will be.
SarahBrown	validation	Adam Kennedy	In the aftermath of Watergate, a number of conspiracy movies appeared, such as this one, written by the late ████████████ ( based on his novel ).
SarahBrown	validation	Tucker	Exactly why is hard to see, as Spiventa is an irritating little man who drives ██████ mad with persistent talk of sex, not what you want to hear when you are behind bars.
SarahBrown	validation	Tucker	Tagge's benefactors kill Spiventa before ██████'s astonished eyes.
SarahBrown	validation	Candice Bergen	Reunited with wife Ellie ( ██████████████ ), and given a new identity ( strangely, he does not attempt to change his appearance.
SarahBrown	validation	Tucker	Shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start ), he settles down, but finds there is a catch - Tagge wants ██████ to do no less than assassinate the President of the United States.
SarahBrown	validation	Tagge	He refuses, so █████ has Ellie abducted...
SarahBrown	validation	Lee Harvey Oswald	Despite the findings of The Warren Commission, the doubt as to whether █████████████████ acted alone persists to this day.
SarahBrown	validation	Tagge	The latter, who sadly passed away earlier this year, is superb as the mysterious █████, who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated, beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall - just like dominoes.
SarahBrown	validation	Hackman	███████'s love scenes with Bergen slow the plot down, and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched.
SarahBrown	validation	Patrick Allen	Presumably the producers thought so too, which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film's entire premise - voiced by British actor █████████████ - warning the audience that 'they' are out there, and that 'they' are out to get us.
SarahBrown	validation	Les Dawson	Comedian ██████████ later spoofed this opening in his B.B.C. show 'The Dawson Watch'.
SarahBrown	validation	Tony Blair's	Last year, 'Taking Liberties', an absurd concoction of lies and half-truths about ████████████ Government turned out to be Britain's answer to 'Reefer Madness'.
SarahBrown	validation	Lew Grade	Surprisingly, 'The Domino Principle' was made by Sir █████████, the legendary British television mogul behind 'The Saint', 'Jesus Of Nazareth' and 'The Muppet Show'.
SarahBrown	validation	Louise Brooks	█████████████ is beautiful and charming, her presence helps enhance this film, but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most.
SarahBrown	validation	Goodrich	"An ultra-nervous old man, ""Mr. ████████,"" terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing, really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it, saying ""You will be next!"""
SarahBrown	validation	Goodrich	"The moment poor Mr. ████████ hangs up the phone and says, ""I feel safer already,"" a monster-type goon named ""Nico"" appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious."
SarahBrown	validation	Goodrich	"Now these crooks have to deal with the ""detectives"" that are coming by the house for Mr. ████████."
SarahBrown	validation	Shemp	█████ was so good that I didn't mind he was taking the great Curly's place.
SarahBrown	validation	Hitler	██████ in Italy.
SarahBrown	validation	Mussolini	Preparations for historical appointment with █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Moon	The Man in the ████ is superbly made, a gentle hearted, joyous and tragic film, beautifully filmed, one in which the actors truly live in the moment rather than act.
SarahBrown	validation	Moon	The simple virtues evinced in Man in the ████ are a joy to behold.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Vincent Zecchino Manasota Key	██████████████████████████████████, Florida 05 April, 2009
SarahBrown	validation	Sean Connery	████████████ did a good job.
SarahBrown	validation	Balasko	However, after a while it just seems an exercise in style (notwithstanding great gags such as ███████ continuing the part of Dussolier, and very good acting by all involved) and I was wondering why Blier made this film.
SarahBrown	validation	George	██████ regains his health and goes back to work.
SarahBrown	validation	Bitto Albertini	While director/co-writer ███████████████ does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft-core sex, this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze.
SarahBrown	validation	George	Emy's descent into vice after she falsely assumes that ██████ has abandoned her is bleak and upsetting; ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending.
SarahBrown	validation	Guido Mancori's	███████████████ polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations.
SarahBrown	validation	Nico Fidenco's	██████████████ funky, throbbing score hits the groovy spot.
SarahBrown	validation	darby	note - during the live ramones set, notice that █████ crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd.
SarahBrown	validation	Ed Harris's	I thought this was one of ███████████ best performances.
SarahBrown	validation	Scarlett Johannson	I also noticed a young ██████████████████ in this movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	██████████....
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	Oh and of course, ██████████ is wonderful as the main character in the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Elene Wood	With ██████████ and others the movie has such a feel to it, you simply can't help but smile
SarahBrown	validation	Cinderella	 And of course the rest is...██████████
SarahBrown	validation	Pete	████
SarahBrown	validation	Michael Dudikoff	Notable for MTV-J Julie Brown (not the 'Downtown' one) showing some skin, and a very early part (albiet small) for ████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Damian Szifron	After his great fist movie called El fondo del mar and the spectacular TV pro-gramme Los simuladores,██████████████ made another great work.
SarahBrown	validation	Szifron	And I have to congrats ███████ for all the talent he has.
SarahBrown	validation	Sita	████ still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.
SarahBrown	validation	Sita	 But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept ████'s desire.
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Smith	"When the end-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer █████████████████ (in his debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the ""creep"" in the London subway."
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Smith	█████████████████ only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background.
SarahBrown	validation	Smith	I reckon this isn't very original, and I'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content, but I forgive █████
SarahBrown	validation	gore	The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous ████!
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Smith	Creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and █████████████████ definitely is a director I'll keep an eye on.
SarahBrown	validation	Pumbaa	It's kinda like MST3000 with Timon and ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Erika Christensen	Busy Phillips has ever done and the best from █████████████████ since Traffic.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar	This film certainly should be in █████ contention.
SarahBrown	validation	Serrault	Kudos to Mr. ████████, for his chilling portrayal.
SarahBrown	validation	Parker Posey	████████████ is great in this movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Katharine Hepburn	I've always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to █████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Lex	Not to mention, Lionels conversations with ███ are always admirable.
SarahBrown	validation	Steven Deknight	Not only does ███████████████ reunite the former justice leaguers, he blends them in with the Smallville formula in such a unique way, that it almost feels like it is a feature length movie.
SarahBrown	validation	clark sais	"maybe it was the music, or the acting, or the fact ██████████ at the end ""we didn't find you, you found us"", kind of made people lose faith in the formula."
SarahBrown	validation	Steve Deknight	But thankfully ██████████████ redeemed himself in this Justice episode.
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver	I mean it would have been soo much cooler if say Green Arrow and Cyborg took off on ██████'s bike (rememeber from the arrow episode).
SarahBrown	validation	Trumpet	Told he would never walk without crutches by doctors, Chief ███████ pulls some strings and a Navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the lad's crippled leg.
SarahBrown	validation	Jess	████ goes on to join the Navy to become a flight officer, flying blimps back at Lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Blake	First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, ████████████, was recently on trial for murdering his wife.
SarahBrown	validation	Brooks	Combined with the cracker-jack direction from ██████ and superb editing in the early scenes (where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers), a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense (even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events).
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Blake's	The film is also anchored nicely by ██████████████ eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Blake's	I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down ██████████████ pallid face in lieu of actual tears.
SarahBrown	validation	Fanshawe(Mark Letheren	The young Dr. ██████████████████████), an avid archaeologist, is dispatched by his Museum boss to the large country home of Squire Richards(Pip Torrens), where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the Squire.
SarahBrown	validation	Patten	Over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the Squire, ██████ overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it..
SarahBrown	validation	M.R. James	The Ghost Story for Christmas series of films made by the BBC sadly ended its initial run of films in 1978 with The Ice House, they were for the most part based on the work of the great ██████████.
SarahBrown	validation	James	In 2005 and 2006 the series was revived briefly and thankfully A View from a Hill also marked a return to the work of █████, whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers.
SarahBrown	validation	Luke Watson	Director ███████████ being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films, but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great Ghost story, his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax, all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum, thus upping the tension and mystery.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra Bernhard	If you ever have the chance to see ███████████████ live in person, you better move on it sweetie.
SarahBrown	validation	Bernhard	Okay, i want it known, Ms. ████████ is a little of these influential entertainers and more.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	It is my opinion that many (and i mean, MANY) comics have lifted, okay outright stolen, so much from this show if not from ██████ herself.
SarahBrown	validation	Bernhard	See, the thing is, ████████ plays by her own rules.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	Most comedians couldn't even touch where ██████ is coming from or going to.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	So, here i was, a year ago, watching ██████ at the Silent Movie Theater, in total awe and joy.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	As for me, I do hope that ██████ will see this.
SarahBrown	validation	Papierhaus	"Ironically, ""██████████"" is a movie I'd never heard of until now, yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s - partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades."
SarahBrown	validation	Anna	"The acting is not brilliant, but merely solid - unlike what some people here claim (they must have dreamt this ""wondrous acting"", much like ████)."
SarahBrown	validation	Burke	It was quite obvious that █████ isn't that young.
SarahBrown	validation	Moon	████ child combines sci-fi, drama, and action with the perfect cast and talent to create the most sensationally moving movie of the time, and great for most audiences.
SarahBrown	validation	Roy	The other stars of the show are the Sigfreid and ███.
SarahBrown	validation	Sopranos	"It took us a couple of episodes to ""get into"" Dark Angel as a story and a series, since we were transitioning from The ████████, a very different mentality framework."
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Blake	Near the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on ████████████ looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face.
SarahBrown	validation	Will Geer	Also, █████████ shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney.
SarahBrown	validation	Devos	█████ is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard pops up for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	This is almost the definition of her role as █████, a put-upon office dogsbody, taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	Devos/Audiard manage █████'s deafness and its attendant, warped inner world with discreet, stylish flair.
SarahBrown	validation	Saura	Seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of █████ are available on DVD in the USA.
SarahBrown	validation	Carmen	"I am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of ""██████,"" a spectacular work of art that is available in Europe but not here (European DVD's won't play on American DVD players)."
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar	Released in December of 1957, Sayonara went on to earn 8 █████ nominations and would pull in 4 wins.
SarahBrown	validation	Marlon Brandos	Ironically ██████████████ character soon finds love of his own in a woman of Japanese descent.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucienne	You get a real feeling watching ████████ ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around.
SarahBrown	validation	Louise Brooks	The expressiveness of █████████████ is perfect and I recommend this film to ANYONE who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert McKimson's '	███████████████████Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts.
SarahBrown	validation	Acrobatty Bunny'	Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', '████████████████ is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty.
SarahBrown	validation	Acrobatty Bunny'	Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, '████████████████ is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at.
SarahBrown	validation	Pinocchio	"In a brilliant Disney parody, he hollers ""█████████"" down the lion's throat!"
SarahBrown	validation	Acrobatty Bunny'	I've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but '████████████████ breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst McKimson's best.
SarahBrown	validation	Baseketball	I thought that ███████████ was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen!
SarahBrown	validation	Baseketball	 I have just bought ███████████ on DVD and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it.
SarahBrown	validation	Baseketball	So overall i think that ███████████ is brilliant movie which everyone should go see, especially if you're younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards.
SarahBrown	validation	Aragorns	"████████ alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword (""Ulrike"" the legend) with scotch tape."
SarahBrown	validation	Brad Dourif	"And ""Strunzdumm"" (the counterpart of Wormtong) indeed has some strong resemblance with ███████████!"
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The ██████ Ultimatum before it had reached the interval!
SarahBrown	validation	Shivam Nair	This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by ███████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Shyan	But █████ doesn't turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. .
SarahBrown	validation	Soha	Then Shyan re-enters into ████'s life.
SarahBrown	validation	Soha	A sensitively made film with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in Delhi, revolves around the delicate ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Abhay	This well crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one's memory  the awkward first kiss & █████'s swift apology;
SarahBrown	validation	Hunter-Niven	Anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie's offhand references - anyone interested in romance will be moved by ████████████, and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworld.
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt Russell	Nonetheless, kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to ████████████ who conveys much with very little.
SarahBrown	validation	Henry Hathaway	██████████████ was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for his love of the people of the early days in US history.
SarahBrown	validation	Brigham Young	However, to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about █████████████ and the Mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Hathaway	I recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that ████████ interpreted in his film.
SarahBrown	validation	Roseanne	████████ reaches back to season one, and tells us that this show has been her rendition of her life.
SarahBrown	validation	Gene Roddenberry	Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks, and I believe ████████████████ would surely be proud.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Muni	█████████ plays a poor Chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage.
SarahBrown	validation	Luise Rainer	████████████ is a servant girl who gets married to Muni.
SarahBrown	validation	William Powell	As the star detective, ██████████████ is alternately starchy and inspired, behaving at times as if he and his suit went to the cleaners and got pressed together.
SarahBrown	validation	Mary Astor	██████████ is very lovely here.
SarahBrown	validation	Martin Scorsese	"As a ""rebuttle"" of sorts to the AFI's top 100 films, the British Film Institute worked out a documentary with ███████████████."
SarahBrown	validation	Scorsese	In this fantastic (though long) documentary, ████████ walks the viewer through several stages of the American History on film.
SarahBrown	validation	Martin Scorsese	Full of bouncy enthusiasm, ███████████████ is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor.
SarahBrown	validation	Stroker Ace	Out of that confusion came a hero, ███████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Ned Beatty's	████████████ performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness.
SarahBrown	validation	Jim Nabors	██████████ is a poet.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	I will begin by saying I am very pleased with this climax of the ██████ trilogy.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	If you are a fan of the first two ██████ movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment.
SarahBrown	validation	Jason Bourne's	I was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all mesh in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of ██████████████ troubled past.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	The fights between ██████ and the assassins are always fun to watch.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	If you choose to watch The ██████ Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but I would still recommend you watch them first.
SarahBrown	validation	Jason Bourne	This would allow you to fully understand the character ████████████ and become attached and be a part of his world.
SarahBrown	validation	Grandfather	"███████████ is only ""here"" every third day."
SarahBrown	validation	Tadashi	"During a village festival ███████ is chosen the ""kirin rider"" or spiritual champion of the peace and justice."
SarahBrown	validation	Tadashi	It unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as ███████ struggles to find the strength to become a hero.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	No one except █████ seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time, or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	I admire the fact that █████ has made a film that is bleak and hopeful, that doesn't shy away from being scary, I mean really scary, especially for kids.
SarahBrown	validation	Harry Potter	This is the same dark territory that should be in the ████████████ movies but rarely is.
SarahBrown	validation	Grimms	This a dark ██████ tale with humor.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	Hats off to █████ for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images.
SarahBrown	validation	Tadashi	One of the main characters is a Yokai which I think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal, it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on ███████'s head.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	(Besides its a good introduction to the films of █████ minus the blood and graphic sex)
SarahBrown	validation	Artemisia	"A fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical renown, ""█████████"" tells the true story of a young Italian woman's impassioned pursuit of artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters."
SarahBrown	validation	Van Dine's	██████████ books still bring pleasure - but are termed excessively flowery by many .
SarahBrown	validation	Michael Curtiz	██████████████ at his best.
SarahBrown	validation	Philo Vance	Lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the ███████████ series.
SarahBrown	validation	William Powell	██████████████ looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best.
SarahBrown	validation	Amanda	"Sort of a ""Fatal Attraction"" for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of ██████'s affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off."
SarahBrown	validation	Erika Christensen	█████████████████ was good but Busy stole the show.
SarahBrown	validation	Busy	It was a nice touch after The Smokers, a movie starring ████, which wasnt all that great.
SarahBrown	validation	Mona Lisa Smile	Forget ███████████████, see Home Room.
SarahBrown	validation	Reese Witherspoon	█████████████████ is as promised surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; really all the (small) cast are quite solid, in their simple 50s American setting.
SarahBrown	validation	Maureen	███████'s character is quite underdeveloped I think.
SarahBrown	validation	Maureen	The pacing of the movie makes it seem that ███████ and Court have only just met, when he gets tractored (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit.
SarahBrown	validation	Moon	Man in the ████ is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination?
SarahBrown	validation	Jason London	For some reason I found ████████████ on a tractor funny.
SarahBrown	validation	Kolchak	Whilst it is universally acknowledged that Fearful Symmetry was heavily influenced by the ███████ episode They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be, whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point.
SarahBrown	validation	James Whitmore	██████████████ was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster, but he pulls it off with style, the teaser being an absolute gem.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████, you have to hand it to the guy.
SarahBrown	validation	Kim	Many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability, especially the young woman (played by OK-vin ███) who becomes the object of the priest's love, lust and affection.
SarahBrown	validation	Poe	"Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular) and also fans of ███'s ""The Tell-tale Heart"" (watch and learn) should lap this up, it's yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainment."
SarahBrown	validation	Cronos	See this if you like: ██████, Near Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man.
SarahBrown	validation	Truman Capote	The book was also excellently written by █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Alexandre	"Sadly, no memorable quotes here, but this one's my favorite: █████████: If you're leaving someone that you have loved, you have to say what I'm telling you now: ""Farewell, I'm going."""
SarahBrown	validation	Alexandre	There is so much tactics involved in the relationships between █████████ and the others, and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth.
SarahBrown	validation	Alexandre	However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as █████████ experiences.
SarahBrown	validation	Marius Goring	The supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in Technicolour - this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor (a fantastic █████████████).
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	Gannon locks ████ up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	████ then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because ███ made the mistake of opening his big mouth.
SarahBrown	validation	Dawson	The ending shootout at night on the muddy ██████ street pretty much takes care of that.
SarahBrown	validation	William Daniels	You'll wind up missing half the glorious Alberta cinematography by ███████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Jacques Audiard's	Running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive French production, █████████████████ gritty crime caper, Sur mes levres ( Read My Lips ).
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	In a Paris construction firm █████, a shy, diminutive young woman sits at her desk, sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	Obnoxious coworkers use the front of █████'s desk to chat and drop off their half-finished Styrofoam cups of coffee.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	Partially deaf, █████ turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome, be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend's baby.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	When her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load, █████ fears she may lose her job.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	At the employment office █████ lists the specifications she wants for her assistant (preferably male) as if she were at a Personals Agency.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	When the agency sends over an unkempt , menacing looking young man, █████ is both shocked and intrigued.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	They leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery, where █████ interviews her prospective assistant.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	When she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison , █████ initially wants nothing to do with Paul, but has a change of heart and hires him on.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	Although she is basically kind toward her helper, █████ now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul	████ learns quickly and becomes an able worker.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	The screenplay borrows elements from Hitchcock, most notably REAR WINDOW, where █████'s lip-reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars.
SarahBrown	validation	Hitchcock	That being said, what one carries away from this movie isn't so much the similarities to classic █████████ thrillers, although those elements are definitely there, but the pervasive view a of a modern day city (in this case Paris) where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy, garish nightlife where sex, drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters.
SarahBrown	validation	Hitchcock	It's █████████ with the gloves off.
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt Russell	████████████ is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats.
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt	████ doesn't talk much.
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt	████ gets angry and kills everyone.
SarahBrown	validation	Arliss Howard	"I was young then, in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great █████████████ and being blown away by ""Big Bad Love"" I bought the DVD of ""Wilder Napalm"" and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years."
SarahBrown	validation	Dennis Quaid	And, ████████████ in full clown make-up, sneakily introduced, angled, hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often.
SarahBrown	validation	Quaid	█████ has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways, with that huge slit mouth span, hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both).
SarahBrown	validation	Griffith	Tulip is based on a real story told in ████████'s family, of her grandparents' generation.
SarahBrown	validation	Griffiths	Writer and director █████████ evidently has further ambitions in both areas, and this multiple award-winning 15-minute short is a fine beginning to her reel.
SarahBrown	validation	Rachel Griffiths	I hope ████████████████ has more stories to tell, she does it so well.
SarahBrown	validation	Denzel Washington	█████████████████ directorial debut and the finished product have nothing to envy other films about the same theme by more accomplished directors.
SarahBrown	validation	Washington	It shows that Mr. ██████████ has learned a lot being on the other side of the camera.
SarahBrown	validation	Derek Luke	One of the best things the film has is, without a doubt, the fine performance by ██████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Tate	The abuse he suffers at the hands of Mrs. ████, his foster mother, is brutal, to say the least.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone	The attempt at the hand of an older woman in the Tate's household of a sexual molestation, gives ███████ a bitter taste that stays with him throughout his adult life, as he has been scarred by the shame he carries with him.
SarahBrown	validation	Cheryl	Antwone finds love at last with ██████, who is patient enough to make him see a different world by the love she and support she gives him.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone	He can help ███████, but he cannot help himself, or his relationship with an adoring wife.
SarahBrown	validation	Kiki	The chief threat to their love is ████'s brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him.
SarahBrown	validation	Kiki	"Ironically, ████'s love ""sickness"" isn't love for another woman, but her illicit, incestuous love for her brother."
SarahBrown	validation	Latecomer	"(█████████ that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary ""Patti Smith: Dream of Life"" sometime around 2040!)"
SarahBrown	validation	baker	Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, and that band dishes out a █████'s dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total blast.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	Although I've never seen the film, I couldn't help but feel like this was ████████████████ version of Twilight.
SarahBrown	validation	Park	The psychological aspect that I love about ████'s previous films is in Thirst, as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it.
SarahBrown	validation	Lassie	It's just like seeing ██████ die at the end of a movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff Wincott	████████████ is not only a Hunk, he can kick butt!
SarahBrown	validation	Bridgette Nielson	Ok, so maybe █████████████████ isn't the first person I'd hire to play a ruthless politician, she did a GREAT job nontheless!
SarahBrown	validation	Cynthia Rothrock	So she's not ████████████████, Who CARES?!
SarahBrown	validation	Mbongeni Ngema	Thank You Mr. ██████████████ for such a astonishing story.
SarahBrown	validation	ASAP.Thank	If there is a VHS, or DVD out there on the play, Please notify me ██████████ You.
SarahBrown	validation	Iris	It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an ████ would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job.
SarahBrown	validation	"Bravo ""The Spaz"	"███████████████"", Bravo!"
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	Did ██████ (yes, she must have) know we would still be here for her some nine years later?
SarahBrown	validation	Steve Carrel	████████████ Proves himself to be a great leading man in this wonderful, original, raunchy breath of fresh air.
SarahBrown	validation	Andy Stitzer	Basically the movie's title says it all: ████████████ is a 40 Year- Old Male who works at an electronics store.
SarahBrown	validation	Andy	His Peers that work in the store with him find out that he's a Virgin during a rather sex dialogue filled poker game, and then ████ has to go through a rather funny as hell Odyessy of rude sexual awakenings, but always screwing up which leads to him not losing his virginity, but he eventually gets lucky in the very end.
SarahBrown	validation	Romantic Adult Comedy	Leave the little ones at home, But Take the entire family to see This awesome █████████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Steve Carrel	Only other thing I can say about it is Too bad ████████████ wasn't recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars Von Triers	███████████████ Europa is an extremely good film.
SarahBrown	validation	Von Trier	█████████ has a very stylized way to tell a story, at least he did have with Europa.
SarahBrown	validation	Parker	The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and ██████ just works flawlessly.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert De Niro	"██████████████ is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide ""in the closet"" to protect his ""reputation""!"
SarahBrown	validation	Stardust	████████ makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout.
SarahBrown	validation	Stardust	So on that note, I highly recommended ████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Damian Szifrón's	"This movie is ████████████████ second immersion in movies after his excellent character study in ""El Fondo del Mar""."
SarahBrown	validation	Ned	███ is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent.
SarahBrown	validation	Jim Dale	████████ brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone Fisher	I just watched ██████████████ on BRAVO.
SarahBrown	validation	Bravo	I saw this movie on █████ in 2008 and only wish I had known about it years ago.
SarahBrown	validation	Norma Khoury	The film's subject is ████████████, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story of sorts concerning a Muslim friend of hers who was murdered by her family for having a relationship with a Christian man.
SarahBrown	validation	Norma	█████ fears for her life, worried about violent backlash over the unsavoury portrait her novel paints of Jordanian Muslims.
SarahBrown	validation	Jordan	She refuses to return to ██████ and show us the facts.
SarahBrown	validation	Broinowski	██████████ is not deterred however, and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us.
SarahBrown	validation	Norma	Naturally, what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow, and ultimately we don't know whether to believe █████ or not.
SarahBrown	validation	Brionowski	That might just be me reading into things a bit too much, it didn't come up in the Q&A with ██████████ after the film, but that's what I took away from it.
SarahBrown	validation	Stephanie Beacham	With excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the Hammer Horror scream queen herself █████████████████, this really is fantastic stuff.
SarahBrown	validation	James Eaves	Despite it's low budget, by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality CG effects to the mix, director ███████████ has created something that feels much bigger.
SarahBrown	validation	Bing Crosby	███████████ reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion.
SarahBrown	validation	Curtis	And dang, these kids are crazy, especially ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	Although the movie doesn't have much ████, it is entertaining, and for some reason you kind of care about the characters.
SarahBrown	validation	Rick Baker	Thanks again to ██████████ who gave me this movie many years ago!
SarahBrown	validation	Martin Scorcese	Huge, exhaustive and passionate summary of American cinema as seen through the eyes of ███████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Gregory Peck	████████████ gives a brilliant performance in this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Peck	The last 15 minutes (or thereabouts) are great and ████ is an absolute joy to watch.
SarahBrown	validation	Peck	It's not awful and I'm sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I were to be honest) to see it is ████.
SarahBrown	validation	John Ritter	However, my view was shot out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny ███████████ accrued.
SarahBrown	validation	John Ritter	The programme stood it's ground and really commended the characters life in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admire res of ███████████, a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything.
SarahBrown	validation	Bridget	I thought this shone threw the acting talents of the three children, particularly that of ███████'s character, who was worried of the last words she said to him.
SarahBrown	validation	Murphy	Often overlooked in the pantheon of ██████ flicks, but this one is worth a look.
SarahBrown	validation	Mardi Gras	Excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted, ordinary beads exchanged during ██████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Ennio Morricone	For the fans of composer ███████████████ this is also a must.
SarahBrown	validation	Suzy Kendall	And I think I have to try to catch more movies with ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Pierce Brosan's	Obviously, I was totally under impression of ███████████████ magnificent role.
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	"Mostly that humor comes from ███████ as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d.... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: ""I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning, after the navy's left town."""
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	███████ says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually.
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	So I recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of ███████ ever.
SarahBrown	validation	Willy	The scene when they meet again in █████'s flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection.
SarahBrown	validation	Walter Matthau	██████████████ gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can, the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization.
SarahBrown	validation	George Burns	████████████ timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film, his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable.
SarahBrown	validation	Joanne Murray	College girl █████████████ takes on the unenviable job of readying the student housing building to become apartments,which includes selling the unneeded furniture This takes place during a break,so a mysterious psycho is stalking the nearly-empty premises on campus.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	The acting is pretty bad,the plot is predictable,but the ████ effects are quite good.
SarahBrown	validation	Amores Perros	█████████████ did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing to me now.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert O. Ragland's	███████████████████ funky score hits the gnarly spot.
SarahBrown	validation	Stanton Fox's	█████████████ stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on.
SarahBrown	validation	Patricia Wymer	Best of all, this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie ██████████████, who positively lights up the screen with her sweet, bubbly personality and captivating beauty.
SarahBrown	validation	Maurice	"Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for the Canadians AND ███████ ""the Rocket"" Richard."
SarahBrown	validation	Whoopi - great	██████████████!
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Downey -	███████████████ refreshing to see him back when he had such potential, before the tabloids.
SarahBrown	validation	Garry	And █████: why did we have to wait so long to see him on film?
SarahBrown	validation	Leesa Gibbons -	███████████████ hadn't been missing her, but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for THAT job, anyway?).
SarahBrown	validation	Sally	Admittedly, I could have done without █████ climbing the drainpipe.
SarahBrown	validation	Lelouch	THE CRANES ARE FLYING is, for the first half at least, supremely entertaining, boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin; a fresh, brisk, spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms; two stunning subjective set-pieces; and a romantic verve that flirts with, but never quite topples into, ███████ territory.
SarahBrown	validation	Boris	When the Nazis invade Russia, █████ secretly volunteers, to the chagrin of his family and lover.
SarahBrown	validation	Veronika	He promises to write to ████████, but never does, thinking maybe she hasn't bothered to see him off, or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable.
SarahBrown	validation	Boris	█████, meanwhile, is killed in action.
SarahBrown	validation	Veronika	████████, disgusted with herself and an adulterous Mark, refuses to believe this, and awaits his return, fostering a young orphan bearing his name.
SarahBrown	validation	Boris	In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than █████'s perceived indifference.
SarahBrown	validation	Veronika	 When Mark tries to force himself on ████████, the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations.
SarahBrown	validation	Veronika	One more grasp for Expressionist overload - ████████'s attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant - is clumsily handled; and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	They would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget, and more ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Martha	██████ was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil Nazi who would kill without warning.
SarahBrown	validation	Howard W. Campbell	Notle plays ██████████████████ who was a double agent working in propaganda during World War II.
SarahBrown	validation	Vonnegut	As with much of ████████'s work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims.
SarahBrown	validation	Nolte	█████ is fantastic - self assured and confident as the younger Campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past.
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy Stewart	But when I saw this movie on TV - as part of a commemorative █████████████ weekend upon his death - I finally GOT IT: I understood, at least in theory, what the Western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation (aside from just action and thrills).
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy Stewart	█████████████ plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the Alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold.
SarahBrown	validation	Walter Brennan	He is joined in this by his lifelong buddy, played by ██████████████ (perhaps the Western cliché character to end them all - but nevertheless enjoyable here, as always) - and no one else.
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	"Pointedly, they are out for themselves, and while ███████ displays his patented charm (come on, we could never really dislike the guy, now could we?), we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self-centered, self-interested character: none of his ""Gosh"" or ""Oh golly gee"" humanism is allowed to come through."
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	He comes on with so much charm and humor, and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with ███████, that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he *is* the bad guy - so that when it finally sinks in, it does so with double force.
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	"Definitely one of the greatest performances I've seen from ███████, showing he could play the renegade, the ""man's man"" just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door."
SarahBrown	validation	Veronica	Like ████████ says, two chicks at one time.
SarahBrown	validation	Veronica	I think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by ████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Marlene Deitrich	The brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while ████████████████ sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this refrain.
SarahBrown	validation	Sabu	"As in ████'s subsequent movies (I didn't see ""Unlucky monkey"" yet, but the other ones are as great) failure, chance and humanism play great roles."
SarahBrown	validation	Tom Tykwer's	so it's more probable that it served as inspiration for ████████████ movie, and not the other way around.
SarahBrown	validation	Murphy	I've seen a lot of stand up shows ,been to a lot of stand up shows, and watch Bet's Comic View, but I have never seen anyone who could match the skills of ██████ on this show.
SarahBrown	validation	Murphy	Also shows that at one time, particularly the early-to mid eighties, that ██████ was funny.
SarahBrown	validation	Clint Eastwood	Another great part is where his mom is like ██████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Petiot	Not only animals, but human voices are often heard - the screams of Gestapo victims, ██████'s patients in his waiting room, monitored by a listening device, just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells.
SarahBrown	validation	Mme Kern	Even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them - when Petiot goes to see ████████, we hear her singing as she works, her voice echoing in the theater, before we ever see her.
SarahBrown	validation	Petiot	This is a ghost story, and these are the voices of ghosts - many of them ██████'s future victims.
SarahBrown	validation	Petiot	It's hard to say, and harder to believe; it's not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Hitler	Just as we learned that ██████ loved dogs, and that Nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men, so we have to recognize that Petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally.
SarahBrown	validation	Bill	This first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren't very funny and had a drama element where ████ (the mother) was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didn't mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped.
SarahBrown	validation	Stanley Kubrick	The director is ███████████████, easily the greatest director who ever lived.
SarahBrown	validation	Johnny	"Not just the classic, ""Here's ██████"" scene."
SarahBrown	validation	Davis	"Yes, I had previously seen █████ in several small parts - and one starring role in ""A Passage to India""."
SarahBrown	validation	Judy Davis	██████████' performance is stunning, I cannot say enough good things about it.
SarahBrown	validation	Claudia Karvan	She shares an amazing on-screen relationship with young ██████████████ (as Ally), this film's other great actress.
SarahBrown	validation	Bret Ratner's	█████████████ piece...
SarahBrown	validation	Ethan Hawke	 Both the Chris Cooper and the ███████████ segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that I've had in the big apple.
SarahBrown	validation	Xica	I look forward to my ████ every night.
SarahBrown	validation	Sharon Small's	"██████████████ ""Trudi"" is the homemaker one (allegedly widowed after September 11th) who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends (who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors)."
SarahBrown	validation	Sharon Stone	Some very good British actors as well as the one and only ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Catherine Tramell	█████████████████ (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people's lives, playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book.
SarahBrown	validation	Hannibal Lecter	Stone could also be described as a sort of female ███████████████, an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan.
SarahBrown	validation	Stanley Kubrick's	So if you're looking for a great movie, get █████████████████ The Shining.
SarahBrown	validation	Brooks	Jones, Hall and ██████ (as director and as writer for adapted screenplay) are Academy Award nominees.
SarahBrown	validation	Bugs	To be more specific, the lions' cage is place exactly over ████' hole.
SarahBrown	validation	Nero	"Once again, Bugs faces dumb opponent, one he calls ""████,"" but lion is fierce and Bugs will need all his wits and somewhat-fake bravado to fend off this beast."
SarahBrown	validation	Stone	The acting was brilliant from all characters, especially Ms.█████ and Morissey.
SarahBrown	validation	Catherine	The plot is interesting even though, this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how █████████ continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels.
SarahBrown	validation	Amanda Tapping	So in summery I Love Stargate (and ██████████████).
SarahBrown	validation	Verdi	Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of █████'s great works.
SarahBrown	validation	Luciano Della Marra	███████████████████ was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.
SarahBrown	validation	Bob McKimson	Director ████████████ offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour.
SarahBrown	validation	Acrobatty Bunny	" Those are the 10 main reasons that keeps ███████████████ as a Bugs Bunny classic and can be found in the ""Bugs Bunny Classics' MGM/UA Video (1989)"""
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver Twist	This was my favourite film as a child, and I have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and I doubt anybody could ever re-make the story of ████████████ on screen, any better than this one did.
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver	Not only did he scare the life out of my when I watched it as a 6 year old, but now as a woman I can empathize more with Nancys character, the bar maid/prostitute who helps ██████ get the life he deserves.
SarahBrown	validation	Janos	Dr. █████ Rukh(Karloff)is on an expedition in Africa trying to find an ancient meteorite.
SarahBrown	validation	Rukh	After finding it, ████ is poisoned by the its radiation.
SarahBrown	validation	Felix	His friend, Dr. █████ Benet(Lugosi)finds a limited remedy to the problem and at the same time realizes the radiation could be used for the good of mankind by curing diseases.
SarahBrown	validation	James Earl Jones	The blame rests in three key areas: (1) the writers who gave ████████████████ some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history, (2) the music team who over-dramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling, even when the film fails to motivate, and lastly but most importantly (3) the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason, no continuity, no flow, sucking the life out of the entire film -- a film about life.
SarahBrown	validation	Sauron	Any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey, the music turned almost into that Mt Doom scene from Lord of the Rings, with the predator portrayed as some kind of ██████ ultimate-evil character.
SarahBrown	validation	Sharon Stone	I think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for ████████████ being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar	It's not an █████ or a cult classic like the first, but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul.
SarahBrown	validation	Catherine Trammell	It's the character of ██████████████████ that helped give way for this sequel.
SarahBrown	validation	David Morrissey	Sure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from ███████████████ who's virtually unknown.
SarahBrown	validation	Mizz Stone	So if you've got beef with ██████████, maybe you should actually SEE the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit?
SarahBrown	validation	Jeanie	Watching the scene when ██████ is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up
SarahBrown	validation	Madge	and then she is telling █████ how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations I had personally had.
SarahBrown	validation	Scorsese	Thre isn't a single ████████ movie I'd place on a list of my favorite movies.
SarahBrown	validation	Scorsese	████████ DOES know what ideas are being explored, and that makes him a compelling, involved speaker on the topic.
SarahBrown	validation	Max Allan Collins	Season 2 leaves you hanging, unless you read the books by █████████████████, then you will know what happens.
SarahBrown	validation	Jessica Alba's	since ██████████████ carrier sky rocketed after the show.
SarahBrown	validation	Firefly	just like the show ███████, which of course FOX canceled as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Hong Sang-Soo's	The Power of Kangwon Province is director ███████████████ second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film, including the multiple connected narratives (in this case, two), and stories of troubled or troubling relationships, as well as a potent dosage of irony.
SarahBrown	validation	Paula	My only complaint was that the character of █████ had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed.
SarahBrown	validation	Porky	And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (█████'s, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the movie holds up well against time.
SarahBrown	validation	Foster	And ██████ is the one with the plan.
SarahBrown	validation	Sally Kellerman	It's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line (███████████████).
SarahBrown	validation	Dorothy Hamill	Dated hair, clothes, and references to Olympic skater ██████████████ haven't hurt the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Yash raj's	Another rule of ██████████ film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent.
SarahBrown	validation	Jodie Foster	I have been a ████████████ fan ever since we were both kids, from her Disney years.
SarahBrown	validation	Jodie	"Where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy (""Little Darlings"", anyone?), █████ went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addiction."
SarahBrown	validation	Porky	This was not █████'s.
SarahBrown	validation	Jodie Foster	But ████████████ continued to show her chops as a real adult actor (a trend started when she was very young in Taxi Driver).
SarahBrown	validation	Barky	7 out of 10 █████
SarahBrown	validation	Keira Knightley's	These are real bodies (█████████████████ excepted) whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later.
SarahBrown	validation	Parminder Nagra	"And, in my book, lead actress ███████████████ is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective, ""luminous,"" but because her performance has an honesty and un-bookish intelligence that's utterly compelling."
SarahBrown	validation	Chadha	"As in ██████'s ""Bride and Prejudice,"" the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that can't be neatly slotted into the stodgy, Sweet Valley High categories of ""best friends"" or ""sisters."""
SarahBrown	validation	Chadha	Perhaps ██████ is even right in her commentary to disavow the film's flirtation with lesbianism.
SarahBrown	validation	Beckham	"""Bend it Like ███████"" has an electricity that can't be reduced to the simple hetero/homosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest."
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar	And yes, the Acting is not going to get nominated for an █████ anytime soon.
SarahBrown	validation	Antoine Fuqua	"""Bait"" marks the sophomore feature for █████████████ (""The Replacement Killers"") and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie."
SarahBrown	validation	Foxx	████ is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning, but throughout the film, I began to catch on.
SarahBrown	validation	Mischa Auer	Without a doubt ███████████ delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs, he even steals the ending, it was great!
SarahBrown	validation	Jack Haley	██████████ is also great to watch, I admit that I only know him from W O OZ and I loved him there, and I also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show.
SarahBrown	validation	Sylvia Kristel	"Before seeing this, I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated ""Emmanuelle"" series starring ██████████████."
SarahBrown	validation	Chai Lee	What makes 'Yellow Emanuelle' so good is it's leading heroine, the beautiful and exotic ████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Emy Wong	She plays her character, ████████ so sweetly, that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her.
SarahBrown	validation	Emy Wong	████████ is a much-respected doctor, statuesque, with a regal quality.
SarahBrown	validation	Emy	███ will remain a virgin until she is married, to a man she has never met.
SarahBrown	validation	Emy	███ decides to do away with custom, and she gives herself to her Western man.
SarahBrown	validation	Wong	But only after a very long courtship, as Doctor ████ is anything but an easy woman.
SarahBrown	validation	Ilona Staller	Neither one counts on a third party, one █████████████, who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games.
SarahBrown	validation	Emy	███ is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man, that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her.
SarahBrown	validation	Sylvia Kristel	If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle, with ██████████████, than you most likely will appreciate this, lesser known classic.
SarahBrown	validation	George	Her father shows ██████, and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees.
SarahBrown	validation	George	For the DVD release there is a subplot about ██████ suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease!
SarahBrown	validation	Sho	Here, he meets ███, an orphan living on the street.
SarahBrown	validation	Gackt	I am amazed at how █████ can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out.
SarahBrown	validation	Bette Davis	I do see what my forebears saw in the youthful ███████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Warren Williams	She's splendid throughout this almost-madcap political comedy which actually stars ███████████████ as the political operative constantly behind on his alimony.
SarahBrown	validation	Vivienne Osborne	████████████████ is brilliant as his ex, and I found myself rooting for her throughout.
SarahBrown	validation	Williams	The ████████ character is not at all sympathetic, and he's not even a decent op.
SarahBrown	validation	Guy Kibbee	██████████ is one of the best at what he does.
SarahBrown	validation	Williams	"If you're of a political mind, you will probably see a party other than the one with which you are affiliated reflected in the fictional ""Progressive Party"" of ████████ and Kibbee."
SarahBrown	validation	Rukh	"Unexpectedly, ████ discovers ""Radium X,"", even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them."
SarahBrown	validation	Hillyer	"Director ███████ used a few standing sets from ""FLASH GORDON"" series which was being filmed at the same time and also inserted some footage of electrical machines from Frankenstein."
SarahBrown	validation	Kyoko	█████ is a beautiful Japanese woman who has run to California to escape from a failed relationship in Japan.
SarahBrown	validation	Ken	███ is a Japanese American manual laborer with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner.
SarahBrown	validation	Al Gore's	"Finally, it has nothing to do with █████████ documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth"" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with ""truths"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already."
SarahBrown	validation	Walther Mathau	question: how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers ██████████████ in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode?
SarahBrown	validation	George Burns	answer: quietly, deadpan, and with perfect timing as ████████████ does here.
SarahBrown	validation	Tsui Hark	Visually stunning and full of Eastern Philosophy, this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director █████████, the man behind some of the best films Hong Kong cinema has produced.
SarahBrown	validation	Jason Bourne	Yeah, ████████████ is back, and this time, he 's here with a vengeance.
SarahBrown	validation	Hollywoodian	"Of course, like every ████████████ movie since the end of the 90's, ""The Bourne Suprematy"" is a super-heroes story."
SarahBrown	validation	Jason Bourne	████████████ is a Captain-America project-like, who's gone completely wrong.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	"And the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world (there's no frontiers in the ██████'s movies, characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), is, as in the best seasons of ""24"", an American enemy, who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him."
SarahBrown	validation	Nickie Parson	Beside all those interesting thematics, the movie isn't flawless : the feminine character of █████████████ is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes.
SarahBrown	validation	Tsui Hark	I particularly enjoyed the fight in Tanger, that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Pike	"This is the dilemma presented to Captain ████████████████ in ""The Cage"" the now-legendary pilot episode of the original Star Trek series."
SarahBrown	validation	Gene Roddenberry	"Famously deemed ""too cerebral"" and ""too cold"" by NBC brass and rejected, ""The Cage"" was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time, and ████████████████ did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste, with the result being this truly classic Star Trek episode, which embeds ""The Cage"" into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale, a landmark in TV history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen..."
SarahBrown	validation	Spock	Star Date 3012: The USS Enterprise diverts to Starbase 11 after Mr. █████ receives an urgent message from the former commander of the Enterprise.
SarahBrown	validation	Pike	Surprisingly, the message cannot be from Captain ████ after all, as he is now confined to a wheelchair, mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident.
SarahBrown	validation	Talos IV	Soon, the Enterprise is headed for the remote, forbidden planet of ████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Kirk	Spock - knowing that ████ must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the Captain to certain death.
SarahBrown	validation	Spock	█████'s encyclopedic knowledge of Starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence.
SarahBrown	validation	Talos IV - a	Spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the Federation and the inhabitants of ████████████ journey taken 13 years earlier by the Enterprise itself under Pike's command.
SarahBrown	validation	Kirk	████ expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail, but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by Pike himself, who turns out to have been lured to Talos IV by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a Federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously.
SarahBrown	validation	Vina	"After Pike's capture, the rest of the ""survivors"" vanish as none of them really existed except ████."
SarahBrown	validation	Silberman	And █████████, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all.
SarahBrown	validation	Díaz	He is told to accompany ████ in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation.
SarahBrown	validation	Silberman	Soon the situation reverts when █████████ himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning.
SarahBrown	validation	Jordi Molla	I never thought ███████████ could be such a great director, after all, I really don't care much for his choice in movies.
SarahBrown	validation	Hayworth	I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always enamored of Ms. ████████'s looks, so I thought I'd give it a try.
SarahBrown	validation	Hayworth	This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms. ████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Gilda	She's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of '█████', where she is sex symbol par excellence).
SarahBrown	validation	Kelly	█████ does one of his tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window.
SarahBrown	validation	Rita	But ████ drives this whole movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Gilda	I find this movie works better than '█████', which I regard as a flawed film.
SarahBrown	validation	Denzel Washington	In his directorial debut, █████████████████ takes a true story that also happens to be a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we have come to expect from Washington's acting efforts, but now we see this touch as a director.
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Walken	██████████████████ is very catlike, and doesn't need stupid make-up, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human.
SarahBrown	validation	Blake Edwards	The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Slaptick	████████ is his forte' after all.
SarahBrown	validation	Julie	█████'s singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen.
SarahBrown	validation	Julie	I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and █████'s singing to them.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	"███████ is sent straight to heaven by default because ""all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind""."
SarahBrown	validation	Frank Morgan	One of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic ████████████ casually and humbly searches for someone to have Christmas dinner with.
SarahBrown	validation	Murphy	The acting is good and ██████ especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant/unlikely hero.
SarahBrown	validation	Ronald Colman	This is the first movie I saw with █████████████ in it
SarahBrown	validation	Reginald Gardiner	█████████████████ has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in.
SarahBrown	validation	Pierce Brosnan	I saw this movie while it was under limited release, mainly for the novelty of seeing ██████████████ with a moustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I have seen all year.
SarahBrown	validation	Parker Posey	"I remember ████████████ on ""As The World Turns"" before she became the Queen of the Independent movies."
SarahBrown	validation	Posey	In this film, █████ shows her potential as a top fledged actress.
SarahBrown	validation	Omar Townsend	In this film with supporting cast that includes █████████████ as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel salesman on the street, who aspires to become a teacher.
SarahBrown	validation	Judy	The supporting cast features a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and only family relative as ████, the librarian who is old fashioned, dedicated and menopausal.
SarahBrown	validation	Mary	████'s life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village of New York City before it became gentrified with yuppies.
SarahBrown	validation	Joan Allen	██████████ plays what appears to be the Good Cop against Strathairn's Bad One.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	"So good is ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" that it gets away with the old one-man-against-the-world bit, this time stretched to ridiculous excesses, as ██████ defies constraints of geography, time, gravity... and physics in general."
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	"And yet, only a clueless pedant would allow ""facts"" interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the ██████ fantasy."
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	"I love the music, I love when ███████ is arriving in Heaven, I love the song ""Let me be surprised""."
SarahBrown	validation	Soylent Green	█████████████ is a classic.
SarahBrown	validation	Soylent Green	They seem to be remaking sci-fi classics these days (i.e. War of the Worlds)and I am hoping some director/producer will re-do █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Orson Welles'	The plot is that a group of Martians mistake a Halloween Rebroadcast of █████████████ War of the Worlds as an account of a real Martian invasion, and conclude they need to get in on the action!
SarahBrown	validation	Goldie Hawn	"""Protocol"" is a hit-and-miss picture starring ███████████ as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting Arab from an assassination attempt."
SarahBrown	validation	Hawn	"████ is excellent as usual even though ""Protocol"" isn't as funny as her best film ""Private Benjamin""."
SarahBrown	validation	Kelly Rippa	"And during these commercial breaks, they had another advertisement in the guise of a ""TV show"" hosted by the oh-so-annoying ███████████ that loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of ""Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True""."
SarahBrown	validation	Odysseus	It tells you the myth attributed to Homer of the Journey home of ████████ after the Troy war.
SarahBrown	validation	Denise Richards	███████████████ on the DVD extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	The direction is very good, managing to show very little actual ████, and relying on your imaginations implied threat.
SarahBrown	validation	Richards	"Much can be said also for the similar manner in which Miss ████████ and Heigel do not remove their clothes...:-( Essentially, the main directorial plus, lies within the ""borrowing"" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks."
SarahBrown	validation	Gerald Fried's	I think a lot of it was ██████████████ score.
SarahBrown	validation	Kirk	"I get the impression that, out of all the girls ████ knew over the years, she may have been the ""sweetest""."
SarahBrown	validation	Ruth	Someone commented online that ████ looked older than he was, yet she wasn't supposed to have aged at all in 15 years.
SarahBrown	validation	McCoy	Considering how much attention Dr. █████ showered on her, it's just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again!
SarahBrown	validation	Spock	One thing missing from the last several I've watched that snuck back in here was, █████ smiling.
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver	Simply put, ██████! is one of the greatest musicals of all time.
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver	"It is filled with memorable songs - ""Food Glorious Food"", ""██████!"", ""Consider Yourself"" and ""Oom-Pah-Pah"" to name just a few - and equally memorable characters."
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver	The story - which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now - revolves around a little orphan boy named ██████ and his life growing up in London.
SarahBrown	validation	Bumble	At first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his fellow orphans but after daring to question Mr. ██████, the overseer, he is sold to a family as a servant.
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver	A multi-Oscar winner and a massive success on its release, ██████! is a worthy contender for the best musical all of time and will delight anyone who loves film.
SarahBrown	validation	Díaz	"As for me, I couldn't stop laughing at every single joke and commentary -""sos malo"" (""you're mean"")... put in the mouth of ████, the greatest one."
SarahBrown	validation	Luis Luque's	I know he's a superb actor, but sometimes I feel his roles unfairly opaque the rest, ████████████ role in this case.
SarahBrown	validation	Luque	I'm not very fond of Argentine television, so I haven't seen much work from █████, but it's pretty obvious that he's an excellent performer.
SarahBrown	validation	Takahisa Zeze	hurray for █████████████ and Gackt!
SarahBrown	validation	Taro Yamamoto	it was █████████████, boy #5 from battle Royale!
SarahBrown	validation	Hyde	 don't get me wrong, i like ████, i worship his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little bit 'off', but i loved that scene where he danced with the dead guy's body killing the other guys.
SarahBrown	validation	Gackt	and █████ wasn't at all that bad too, i preferred how his character was kind of aloof from the start.
SarahBrown	validation	lee-Hom Wang	nothing much i can say about my background on ████████████, i won't pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with the star-studded cast.
SarahBrown	validation	Parker Posey's	I remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and I was floored by ██████████████ performance.
SarahBrown	validation	Parker Posey	Not too serious, mostly funny, and ████████████ definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gem.
SarahBrown	validation	Diaz	I especially liked the ████ character (reminded me of every single struggling DJ I've ever known).
SarahBrown	validation	Rugrats Notice	██████████████ a word with only capital letters?
SarahBrown	validation	Nick	That means this is the ████ show I'm going to talk about.
SarahBrown	validation	Nick	This is one ████ show that you will simply have your funny bone tickled sooner or later!
SarahBrown	validation	Earthworm Jim	And the humor is all done in some style of █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Catscratch	" So in conclusion, ""██████████"" is one of the Nicktoons series, like ""Invader Zim"" and ""MLAATR"", which becomes very, very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less."
SarahBrown	validation	Santons	███████ is framed, by working undercover without the authority from his superiors, in the Bone shooting.
SarahBrown	validation	Pappas	"A bit over-plotted ""City Hall"" does show how big city corruption can filter up, as well as down, to everyone in city government without them, like Mayor ██████, even knowing about it."
SarahBrown	validation	Pappas	Mayor ██████ was looking forward to much bigger things, like Governor or even President, in his future political pursuits.
SarahBrown	validation	Kevin Calhoun	As it turned out his top deputy █████████████ in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise.
SarahBrown	validation	Tito Zapatti	Who's decision in letting ████████████ off made this whole disaster, which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide, possible!
SarahBrown	validation	Vincent Price's	███████████████ follow-up to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon, similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit resourceful  showman.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	I saw the The ██████ Ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, wow!
SarahBrown	validation	Jason	But I it wasn't just action in this film, █████ doesn't just kill and run.
SarahBrown	validation	Bigas Luna's	I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in ████████████ movies (also director of Jamon, Jamon).
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	We see a frail 82 year old Gen.█████████ give the commencement speech to the graduating class of 1962 about what an honor it is to serve their country.
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	The film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on Gen. █████████'s brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of WWII on the besieged island of Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942.
SarahBrown	validation	MacArther	In the two years up until the invasion of the Philippine Islands Gen. █████████ battered the Japanese forces in the South Pafific in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops into surrender.
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	 It was in 1950/51 in the Korean War that Gen. █████████ achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat.
SarahBrown	validation	MacArther	After outflanking the advancing North Korean Army in the brilliant and perfectly executed, with the invading US Marines suffering less then 100 casualties, back door or left hook invasion of Inchon Gen. █████████ feeling invincible sent the US/UN forces under his command to the very border, along the Yalu River, of Communist Red China.
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	Told by his subordinates that he's facing the threat of a massive ground attack by Communist Chinese troops Gen. █████████ pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the US & UN forces to ribbons.
SarahBrown	validation	Pres	Shocked and humiliated in what he allowed, due mostly to his own arrogance, to happened MacArthur went on the offensive not against the advancing Communist Chinese and Noth Koreans forces but his own Commander and Chief ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Pres	For ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Pres	On April 11, 1951 ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Pres	████.
SarahBrown	validation	Pres	████.
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	Truman''s controversial decision to dump the very popular Gen. █████████ also cost him his re-election in 1952 with his polls numbers so low-in the mid 20's- that he withdrew-in March of that year- from the US Presidential Campaign!
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	In was Gen. █████████'s misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars.
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	With the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out, like Gen. █████████ wanted to, against the Red Chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the US USSR & Red China but the entire world!
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	It was that important reality of future war that Gen. █████████ was never taught, since the A and H Bomb weren't yet invented, in West Point.
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	Back to 1962 we can now see that Gen. █████████, after finishing his commencement speech at West Point, had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as , since his retirement from the US Military, elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it.
SarahBrown	validation	MacArthur	It took a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, for Gen. █████████ to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, like himself, really was!
SarahBrown	validation	Spielberg	"Rating ""10/10"" Master piece Some years ago, i heard █████████ comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance."
SarahBrown	validation	Oprah	Even █████ acts well in this one !
SarahBrown	validation	howard hughes	on one hand, they are veritable geniuses, and on the other, painfully self-destructive (it's a lot like people like █████████████
SarahBrown	validation	norman maclean	for ██████████████, a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur, and who was to blame.
SarahBrown	validation	Zizek	Yet one shouldn't go into seeing this- if you can find it that is, I got to see it almost by luck- thinking █████ will just try and dissect all of the psycho-sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse, deranged manner.
SarahBrown	validation	Marx	If anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise- would one think of three of the ████ brothers as representations of the Id, Super-Ego and Ego (Harpo's example is most dead-on for me).
SarahBrown	validation	Zizek	The ideals of fatherhood, male sexuality, the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality (at which point █████ rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare's creation), and female subjectivity, are explored perhaps most dead-on with Vertigo.
SarahBrown	validation	Zizek	Now it would be one thing if █████ himself went about making these sincere, excited, and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice-over as Scorsese does.
SarahBrown	validation	Frank Booth	"Funniest is first seeing him in the boat ""heading"" towards the same dock Tippi Hedren's boat heads to at the beginning of the Birds; equally funny is as he waters the Blue Velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi-faceted points of ███████████; only one, when he's in Solaris-like territory, does it seem a little cheesy."
SarahBrown	validation	Zizek	█████ is a powerful writer with his work, and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place, to be entertained, sure, but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there, as he put it, looking into a toilet.
SarahBrown	validation	Freud	It's probably one of the greatest films about cinema, and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how █████ works its way into films regarding desire, the Id/Super-Ego/Ego, and of the supernatural in fantasy, that you may never see...unless distribution finally kicks in, if only on the smallest levels.
SarahBrown	validation	Georges	On the eighth day God created ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Georges	But the same as an eighth day doesn't fit into the week, ███████ doesn't fit into the modern world: He has Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, shunted off to an asylum after his mother's death four years ago.
SarahBrown	validation	Harry	█████ is another man that isn't loved anymore.
SarahBrown	validation	Harry	█████ is a highly ranked businessman.
SarahBrown	validation	Georges	But ███████ can't be shaken off.
SarahBrown	validation	Georges	It is ███████ who opens a new access to the world for him and who makes him view his life with different eyes.
SarahBrown	validation	Harry	It is no surprise that █████ now cannot avoid failing in his job.
SarahBrown	validation	Georges	███████ is destroyed by the impossibility of love to the opposite sex and can see no other way out but to commit suicide.
SarahBrown	validation	Harry	█████ turns into a city tramp, who asks the car drivers that are waiting in front of the traffic lights for charity.
SarahBrown	validation	Georges	It is ███████, the mongol, who seems to be capable of showing the way out of the dilemma, but unfortunately his plea comes to a bad end.
SarahBrown	validation	Ernest Borgnine	███████████████ was so wasted in this movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie Murphy	It shows ████████████ dressed in tight red clothes(Old
SarahBrown	validation	Shahid	Both have acted very well, especially ██████ who looks great in the film.
SarahBrown	validation	Amrita	██████ looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	The father figure is ███████, a violent man with a short fuse.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandy	"█████, his ""brother"", is the experienced hunter who is tired of killing but needs the job after losing his cattle."
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	"The grandfather (and moral compass) is an alcoholic buffalo skinner; ███████'s ""wife"" is an Indian woman whose companions he killed after they stole his horses."
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	███████ is clearly the most interesting figure.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	███████ is so thoroughly unlikable from the very beginning that we never have any reason to care about what happens to him or his family.
SarahBrown	validation	Jaco van Dormael	████████████████ does a wonderful job with the script and direction.
SarahBrown	validation	John Ford's	"A good film with--for its time--an intense, sprawling, rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of ███████████ ""The Searchers"" though not so brutal."
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	The story starts fast and doesn't let up, with several scenes of really good dialog between (███████'s)
SarahBrown	validation	Mann-Stewart	"This film is in some ways reminiscent of ""Bend of the River"" (1952), also a ████████████ work, but I found it far less sentimental and more interesting."
SarahBrown	validation	Corrine Calvert	There are a few caveats: a too-quickly wrapped up (and rather sentimental) ending; 24-year-old ███████████████ is not very convincing as a naive French teenager, and of course the film takes place in the Mythic West, a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics don't apply.
SarahBrown	validation	James Stewart	█████████████ is surprisingly good as a dark, disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself, and the mountain scenery can't be beat.
SarahBrown	validation	Ho	██, ho, homicidal maniac!
SarahBrown	validation	Kris Kringle	Complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly ████████████ escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit.
SarahBrown	validation	I´ve	"""Spaced Invaders"" is one of the funniest movies, ████ ever seen."
SarahBrown	validation	Tsui Hark	When █████████ experiments, nothing and no one can withstand him.
SarahBrown	validation	Tsui Hark	When █████████ experiments, nothing and no one can withstand him.
SarahBrown	validation	William Powell	Fortunately they assigned suave ██████████████ first to the character.
SarahBrown	validation	Vance	The other question as always with Warner Brothers executives is why they chose █████ as a character; their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law, with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack Okey	█████████ did the good art direction.
SarahBrown	validation	Berhard Kaun	The music by ████████████ is serviceable; Orry-Kelly did the costumes.
SarahBrown	validation	William Reese	█████████████ provided the mostly-indoor cinematography.
SarahBrown	validation	Eugene Palette	██████████████ is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to Vance, with his very professional timing.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Cavangh	The other actor who comes off best is handsome ████████████, very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part.
SarahBrown	validation	Mary Astor	██████████ is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved.
SarahBrown	validation	James lee	█████████ as the abused Chinese servant is excellent and intelligent.
SarahBrown	validation	Vance	First there is shad doings at a dog show, where █████, Coe and Cavanagh are all showing West Highland terriers.
SarahBrown	validation	Coe	The second portion of the scene involves a leave-taking; someone is confused enough by who has gone where, after ███ parts from his girl friend, Vinson, to murder his nice brother by mistake.
SarahBrown	validation	Curtiz	This is a more-than-good little mystery, which skilled Hungarian-born director ██████ took quite seriously.
SarahBrown	validation	Vance	Many writers, critics and experts, myself included, consider this to be the best of the █████ projects, although others are estimable as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Henry Bromwell	 ██████████████ directed this film with a sure hand, and it shows.
SarahBrown	validation	Alex	████, is a man living in turmoil.
SarahBrown	validation	Parks	In going to Dr. █████, he is trying to find absolution, although, he doesn't find it there.
SarahBrown	validation	Alex	On the contrary, there is a dramatic twist when ████ learns about who is supposed to kill next.
SarahBrown	validation	John Ritter	One of the best things in the movie is the late ███████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Parks	He is equally convincing as Dr. █████, the man who unravels the mystery.
SarahBrown	validation	Donald Sutherland	█████████████████, as the grandfather is perfect.
SarahBrown	validation	Barbara Bain	Also ████████████, in a rare appearance, is the grandmother from hell.
SarahBrown	validation	David Dorfman	█████████████, is a delight in the film.
SarahBrown	validation	Sabu	One of my favorite films of all time by genius director ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Moynahan	There is no way I'll let myself believe that Ms. ████████'s pregnancy had anything to do with it.
SarahBrown	validation	Mommie Dearest	"Yes, I did, as I sit here red-faced, remembering having felt almost guilty as I watched it a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to watch something as inconsequential (in comparison) as ""██████████████."""
SarahBrown	validation	Burt	Adam and ████ are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile is going to be sold off for charity.
SarahBrown	validation	Burt	It really was quite interesting to get some behind the scenes looks at the old series, and Adam and ████ just stepped perfectly back into character (even though they weren't really in character - well, you'd have to watch it to see what I mean.)
SarahBrown	validation	Burt	But if you grew up with Adam and ████ and are still willing to admit that you never missed an episode - well, this one's for you.
SarahBrown	validation	Ashton Kutcher	In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if ██████████████ found his car or not?
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	█████ is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul	████ is just out of jail, and his past is not entirely behind him.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	"The most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when █████ can hear and when she can't -- a sort of ""point of hear"" (like point of view)."
SarahBrown	validation	Roger	In this documentary we meet █████, the rich manager of a factory in China that makes beads and other trinkets sold and traded at Mardi Gras in New Orleans.
SarahBrown	validation	Roger	█████ claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides, but interviews with four of them tell quite another story.
SarahBrown	validation	Mardi Gras	The girls' bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of ██████████ itself.
SarahBrown	validation	David Redmon	Filmmaker ████████████ should be lauded for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a Chinese factory compound, and for landing a revealing on-camera interview with the head of the U.S. company that imports and sells the beads.
SarahBrown	validation	Tobias Schneebaum	This film follows anthropologist █████████████████, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to West Papua and then Peru.
SarahBrown	validation	Asmat	Author of several books documenting his time with both the █████ people of West Papua and the cannibalistic Amazonians in Peru, Tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become.
SarahBrown	validation	Helen Hunt	More importantly ██████████ caught my eye.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	██████ was just a parasite because he did not work, he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes.
SarahBrown	validation	Umeki	"Another comment was made about Myoshi █████ appearing ""cold""."
SarahBrown	validation	Helen	If I were █████ I would have conveniently forgotten I was still married the minute I laid eyes on him...
SarahBrown	validation	Kate	Pal ████ Rambeau(Dey Young, whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide her stunning beauty)joins forces with Riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good which is Togar's desired mission.
SarahBrown	validation	Clint Howard	"████████████ steals the film almost(honestly, who can steal this film away from Soles?)as Eaglebauer, ""the supplier"" who can get everyone almost anything."
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Bartel	███████████ is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff's when he enjoys a concert of THE RAMONES.
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Cross	Let's begin with that theme song sung by █████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Jill	████ would later star on LA Law.
SarahBrown	validation	John Gielgud	Anyway, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir ████████████ OM who won an Academy Award for his performance in the film as Best Supporting Actor.
SarahBrown	validation	Liza	No, ████ doesn't get to sing.
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Pike	████████████████, his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed, to return there.
SarahBrown	validation	Talos IV	Because to have any contact at all with ████████ invites a death sentence.
SarahBrown	validation	Kirk	"████ was off the ship) for arrest and says, ""The charge is mutiny, Dr.; I never received orders to take over the ship."""
SarahBrown	validation	Spock	Pike to get to Talos IV even at risk of Mr. █████'s death.
SarahBrown	validation	Meg Wyllie	And ██████████ as The Keeper (the head Talosian) is wonderful.
SarahBrown	validation	Meg Wyllie	██████████ LOOKS like an alien and I do NOT mean that unkindly.
SarahBrown	validation	Sidney Franklin	1st watched 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-███████████████):
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Muni	The movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Wong	It chronicles , ████ Long(the character played by Muni) and how he works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started.
SarahBrown	validation	Luise Rainer	The relationship between him and his wife, played by ████████████, is the main thread of the story(besides the land itself) and despite the obvious non-Chinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it's people.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscars	The scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of th movie really looks good warranting the Best Cinematography award at the ██████ in that year.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeremy Sumpter	██████████████ is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today, and he is perfectly cast as the young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictional New York Empires (great name!).
SarahBrown	validation	Tupiniquins	In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of the Frenches and their enemies are the ███████████, friends of the Portugueses.
SarahBrown	validation	Ana Maria Magalhães	The Frenchman becomes their slave, and maritally lives with Seboipepe (███████████████████).
SarahBrown	validation	Tupiniquins	Later, he uses powder in the cannons that the Portuguese left behind to defeat the ███████████ in a battle.
SarahBrown	validation	Ana Maria Magalhães	The actors and actresses perform naked and ███████████████████ is magnificent, showing a wonderful body and giving a stunning performance.
SarahBrown	validation	Zé Rodrix	The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Jean Arthur	The action takes us from an Indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with ███████████ excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives.
SarahBrown	validation	Cooper	This is followed by her and ██████ being taken to the war camp and being tortured.
SarahBrown	validation	Jean Arthur	███████████ is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.
SarahBrown	validation	Gene Roddenberry	"It is a well known fact that when ████████████████ first pitched Star Trek to NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected for being ""too cerebral""."
SarahBrown	validation	Spock	Naturally, being a logical creature, █████ turns himself in and arranges a court-martial so that he can justify his actions.
SarahBrown	validation	Roddenberry	What really impresses is how ███████████ creates the connection between The Cage and the rest of the Star Trek universe, by coming up with a particular type of flashback (to say more would be too much) that allows everyone, on screen and off, to see what could have been of Trek, had NBC not turned down the original project.
SarahBrown	validation	Forrest Gump	This film, I thought, was the great journey that ████████████ should have been.
SarahBrown	validation	Jim	███ works in an advertising agency raising US$ 15,000.00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to the lack of space.
SarahBrown	validation	Jim	"███ checks the information with other engineers and all of them condemn the place and sooner he finds that he bought a ""money pit"" instead of a dream house."
SarahBrown	validation	Blandings Builds	"""Mr. ████████████████ his Own House"" is an extremely funny comedy, with witty lines and top-notch screenplay."
SarahBrown	validation	Cary Grant	██████████ is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse of accomplishing with the American Dream of owning a huge house that finds that made bad choice, while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend.
SarahBrown	validation	Tom Hanks	"In 1986, █████████ worked in a very funny movie visibly inspired in this delightful classic, ""The Money Pit""."
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Walken's	I don't think it brings ████████████████████ reputation down either as his reputation was on the wane back then anyway.
SarahBrown	validation	Michael Ironside	As for ████████████████, he has been in some of the great funny while not trying to be serious films.
SarahBrown	validation	McBain	 If anyone reads this looking for information on ██████ (and I seriously doubt there'll be too many) just know that it is a hilarious movie and should be viewed with a smile on your face!
SarahBrown	validation	yaoi	GACKTnHYDE=hawt ████ love?
SarahBrown	validation	Gackt	The movie was surprisingly watchable, even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun-chucks every two scenes, and the acting on █████'s part was quite good.
SarahBrown	validation	Denzel Washington	This film, which is based on a true story, comes from first time director and long time actor, █████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Denzel Washington	█████████████████ has given us some of the best performances of the last decade, as a black soldier in the Civil War in Glory, and a lawyer in the acclaimed Philadelphia.
SarahBrown	validation	Denzel Washington	And of course, he made special notoriety last year when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Training Day, in which █████████████████ became the first African American to receive the award for Best Actor.
SarahBrown	validation	Derek Luke	Fisher is played by ██████████, who is new to the silver screen, but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as King of Queens, and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of Biker Boyz.
SarahBrown	validation	Denzel Washington	"	This is a truly well done film from █████████████████, considering it was his first time directing."
SarahBrown	validation	Davenport	█████████ helps Antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life, by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone Fisher	However, ██████████████ is a true story, and I don't think that Washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone	Don't get me wrong, there are moments when we see ███████ fighting, carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him.
SarahBrown	validation	Denzel Washington	I think it shows real character on the part of █████████████████ to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in Hollywood films, even those based on true stories.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone Fisher	One other point that I would like to bring up about ██████████████ is the acting.
SarahBrown	validation	Viola Davis	One actress that I would like to point out in this film is ███████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone	She plays ███████'s mother, but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all, but not so much because she appears at the end of the film, but more because she in shock that her long lost son, Antwone has found her.
SarahBrown	validation	Steven Soderberg's	In ██████████████████ remake of Solaris, she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone Fisher	Nonetheless, ██████████████ is a very good movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Denzel Washington	█████████████████, as always, pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut.
SarahBrown	validation	Derek Luke	Also, ██████████ is a very talented actor.
SarahBrown	validation	Antwone Fisher	██████████████ is based on the book `Finding Fish: A Memoir,' by Antwone Quenton Fisher.
SarahBrown	validation	Lear	"""Sir"" has played ████ over 200 times,but tonight he can't remember his opening lines."
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	It's easy to write off his portrayal of ██████ as an exercise in stereotyping.
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	There were - and I strongly suspect still are - many men just like ██████ in The Profession.
SarahBrown	validation	Courtenay	I believe the vast majority of them would hoot with approving laughter at Mr █████████'s portrait.
SarahBrown	validation	Freddie Jones	"""Sir"" was played by the great Mr █████████████ to huge acclaim from the audience."
SarahBrown	validation	Mr Courtenay's	"It was a memorable performance that overshadowed ██████████████,reducing him rather to an ""also - ran"" as opposed to an actor on level - billing."
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	"The idea that ""Sir"" and ""██████"" might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window."
SarahBrown	validation	Hari - kiri	When the British cinema virtually committed ███████████ in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door.
SarahBrown	validation	Diane Keaton	Aggie (████████████) is an accomplished and award-winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit.
SarahBrown	validation	Hugh	████ is smitten.
SarahBrown	validation	Hugh	████ and Aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie	My favourite character is ███████ because he learns to be a good dog.
SarahBrown	validation	Dorothy	I remembered it as very mysterious situations, and a mixture of melancholic things, like the fate of ███████ and the personal future of Bogdanovich.
SarahBrown	validation	Henry V. I	I figured 4 hours would be great, I've been a fan of Branagh; Dead Again, ██████████ was completely overwhelmed by the direction, acting, cinematography that this film captured.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscars	And I don't know what happened at the ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Judd Nelson	I also thought that the cast in this movie was great, ███████████ is always the best!
SarahBrown	validation	Chris Martin	With a magnificent soundtrack featuring Faultline & ████████████ and Vama Veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love...
SarahBrown	validation	gore	The film delivers in the shock, ████ and atmosphere department.
SarahBrown	validation	Chris Young	It only seems fair that ███████████ went on to be one of the best composers in the business.
SarahBrown	validation	Hickok	Even if might not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important about ██████ and about the time it takes place.
SarahBrown	validation	Anthony Quinn	█████████████ has a very short appearance, that already shows what a great actor he was going to become.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack	"I LOVE ████'s jokes like 'The cliché is...' or ""Over the top cliché guy, black, oily skin, kinda spooky...""."
SarahBrown	validation	Daniel	██████'s starting to catch up on him to!
SarahBrown	validation	Jack	Good thing ████'s not on the team anymore (in a way) or else it would have been sarcasm mania!!!!I just love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I'm starting to pick up facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c...
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie Cox	███████████ (I had never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good leading man; he was so earnest and romantic, me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie Cox	The chemistry between her and ███████████ was extremely good, the casting was quite perfect.
SarahBrown	validation	Septimus	I laughed so hard at that one scene where ████████ comes on the ship...
SarahBrown	validation	Simba	"Is it better than ""█████'s Pride""?"
SarahBrown	validation	Simba	"Though ""█████'s Pride"" wasn't exactly bad, it did suffer some problems: lack of an good script and bad characterizations, which made impact of what otherwise a okay film."
SarahBrown	validation	Simba	Storywise, this is Timon's story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his tale with █████'s, it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at times.
SarahBrown	validation	Blanding	Will Mr. ████████'s ever get his dream house?
SarahBrown	validation	Loy	███ is a always a joy to watch.
SarahBrown	validation	William Powell	The Thin Man films she made with ██████████████ are near perfect.
SarahBrown	validation	Douglas	And ███████ has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years.
SarahBrown	validation	Douglas	███████ also appeared in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine.
SarahBrown	validation	Blanding	- However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments the ████████'s find themselves in are easily relatable to today.
SarahBrown	validation	Blandings	"The biggest complaint I have about Mr. █████████ is the whole ""wife in love with best friend"" subplot."
SarahBrown	validation	John Malkovich	It reminds me a lot of Being ██████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Michael Cimino's	Heartland was in production about the same time as ████████████████ Heaven's Gate - Heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film.
SarahBrown	validation	John Kassir	This time there are Christmas themed opening & closing Crypt Keeper (███████████) segments complete with the usual puns.
SarahBrown	validation	Zemeckis	Director ████████ does a good job & there's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of Christmas influence as well.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	There's not much ████ here, someone has a poker stuck in their head, someone's face is cut with an icicle, someone's arm is cut with an axe & there's some blood splatter but generally speaking it's not that graphic.
SarahBrown	validation	Ashton Kutcher	Without Topher grace or ██████████████ the show simply fell apart.
SarahBrown	validation	Alessandro Alatri	█████████████████ is a Roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the Milanese philosophy.
SarahBrown	validation	Ned	There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ███ looked at!
SarahBrown	validation	John Wayne	When ██████████ filmed his Alamo story he had built a complete Alamo set in the town of Brackettsville, Texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction.
SarahBrown	validation	Wayne	Tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films, but Tinkle who was alive back then when the █████ film was done and he was not pleased with the result.
SarahBrown	validation	Travis	One thing that was not explored and hasn't been was ██████'s hyperactive sex drive.
SarahBrown	validation	Bowie	And of course he did design the █████ knife, done to his specifications.
SarahBrown	validation	Antonio De	However the main asset that The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory has is a full blown portrayal of ██████████ Lopez De Santa Anna, the president of Mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the North Americans who've come to settle in Texas at Mexican invitation.
SarahBrown	validation	Benito Juarez	He was also quite the scoundrel, but he was the best Mexico produced until a genuine reformer named █████████████ came along.
SarahBrown	validation	Greene	But within the limits imposed on him, ██████ does a fine job.
SarahBrown	validation	John Wayne's	For a romantic telling of The Alamo tale by all means see ████████████ version, but for historical content I recommend this film highly.
SarahBrown	validation	Goro	Not disappointing because I'm one of those die hard SMAP fans who need to see all their works and I finally got to see the so called hot film of ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Goro	But I couldn't believe ████ was forced to make a movie as such.
SarahBrown	validation	Debra Jo Rupp	█████████████ plays well in this ensemble cast too.
SarahBrown	validation	Danny Masterson	"███████████████, the oldest actor of the ""kids"" is very good too."
SarahBrown	validation	John Cusack	███████████ gives a subdued and generally flawless performance, without going into caricature of a New Orleans dialect, or sliding into melodrama during the films climax.
SarahBrown	validation	Danny Aiello	████████████ as a burrough political chief, is also very good.
SarahBrown	validation	GEORGE LOPEZ	"""████████████,"" in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic!"
SarahBrown	validation	Brooks	But it's the handling of the story, moments of moot, the performances, a pure cinematic touch that ██████ and his absolutely marvelous (the late/great) DP Conrad Hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white, and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama (save perhaps for near the end, which is pitch perfect).
SarahBrown	validation	Hickcock	"The air of tragedy hangs over the story, and not so much because of the killings themselves, no matter how brutal they are as the ""third"" man that is conjured up, as the narrator observes, by Smith and ████████ teaming up, but because of the inevitability of the story."
SarahBrown	validation	Smith	We see how Smith had an abusive, psychotic father, but that █████ loved and hated him.
SarahBrown	validation	Capote	The complexity there is too much for the movie, maybe even too much for ██████'s book (which, I should confess, I've still yet to read, though I plan to).
SarahBrown	validation	Hickcock	And we see ████████ is this creature of slick confidence (i.e. getting the suit and other things with bad checks), but without any deep-rooted explanation to it all.
SarahBrown	validation	Tessa	I remember feeling like █████.
SarahBrown	validation	Tessa	Heck, I remember being █████.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director ██████████████ is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra Bernhard's	█████████████████ Without You
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	██████ tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of American pop culture to an audience that doesn't completely see it.
SarahBrown	validation	Madonna	"In L.A. she's playing to a predominantly black audience, trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is ""Shashonna,"" a ███████-look-alike stripper."
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	But, if she's going down, ██████'s doing so with style and force, conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability ... right to the point at which she's naked (literally), pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom.
SarahBrown	validation	Ishtar	"She expounds on the excessiveness of Hollywood, consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him, saying ""Mister, if this is about ██████, I'm getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that's too self-indulgent even for me!"""
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	██████ illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	Dressed as a Cosmo girl, ██████ retells her young-girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	"██████ extols the opening of sexuality in society: ""When he touches you in the night, does it feel all right, or does it feel real?"
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	At the same time, the idealized, fictional incarnation of ██████ -- her self-generated mirror image -- floats around town, a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the Kabala, studying chemistry and listening to NWA rap music.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra Bernhard	In Without You I'm Nothing, ███████████████ explores emotions and existences that, up until then, she'd only toyed with as a regular guest on Late Night With David Letterman.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	This approach to comedy would change ██████'s direction forever and mark the more mature, more personable entertainer to come.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	But consider the emptiness of the world ██████ paints for you, and you'll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is.
SarahBrown	validation	Sandra	Before you know it, the two of you will be trading ██████ barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else.
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie Murphy'	Whenever I see most reviews it's called 'a misfire for █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Murphy	"""The Golden Child"" is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clichés, and gives ██████ one of his best roles."
SarahBrown	validation	Steven Spielberg	████████████████ started it with Indiana Jones; it's unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless.
SarahBrown	validation	Bette Davis	The usual terrific ███████████ maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943.
SarahBrown	validation	Lukas	Encounting treachery around them, █████ successfully deals with the situation.
SarahBrown	validation	Shue	"The only part lacking in this movie is ████'s part as the daughter wanting to follow in her ""aunt's"" footsteps as a daytime soap star."
SarahBrown	validation	Reese Witherspoon's	The acting was fabulous, the story line was great, and this was a perfect start for ███████████████████ career.
SarahBrown	validation	Michael Cacoyannis	'Iphigenia' is the great achievement of ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Tatiana Papamoschou	Newcomer ███████████████████ is extremely impressive as Iphigenia.
SarahBrown	validation	Irene Papas	Equally impressive is ███████████ ,who even though she sometimes seems over the top, it is very realistic.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar	Rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film █████ by only 1 vote!!!
SarahBrown	validation	Pacino	*You know, ██████ does chew it up in one particular scene, but precisely because it's required.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter Weir's	It's intriguing, like all ████████████ stuff, but it's not always as attention-holding as I would have liked.
SarahBrown	validation	Weir)but	I found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me (because they are very well handled by the film's director ████████ at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them.
SarahBrown	validation	Weir	"It starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout (most notably the bizarre, ""belching"" sound design)and strong direction; but it just didn't entertain me like ████'s later films do."
SarahBrown	validation	Gilson	But as the film goes along ██████ keeps doing more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him.
SarahBrown	validation	Gilson	██████ is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or human beings.
SarahBrown	validation	Debra Paget	███████████ as the Indian girl is a surprising character considering the self imposed censorship of that time.
SarahBrown	validation	Gilson	She lies with ██████ in total resignation even though she hates him.
SarahBrown	validation	Gilson	The last scene of a frozen ██████, is unforgettable.
SarahBrown	validation	Stephen Bishop	The music from ██████████████ (Tootsie songs) made the film even better
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	Captain ███████ comes across aliens who have time travel technology.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	███████ visits Tuvok.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	In the institution, Tuvok cries, asking for '███████' to please, please come back to him.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	███████ decides to commandeer a federation shuttle and equip it with weapons technology 20 years ahead of the Borg, in the hopes of going back in time and using this new technology to guide Voyager to the Warp Conduit.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	When she goes back in time and links up with Voyager, ███████ meets her younger self.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	To increase their chances of success the older ███████ plans to distract the Borg with her shuttle craft.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	The Borg actually capture ███████ and her shuttle.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	The Borg Queen personally assimilates Captain ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	But ███████'s expected this!
SarahBrown	validation	Judy Davis	You gotta love ██████████, no matter what she's in, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural, convincing performance.
SarahBrown	validation	Reese Witherspoon	All the acting is amazing and █████████████████ gives a great performance in her first movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Jess Franco's	I haven't seen all of █████████████ movies, I have seen 5, I think, and there are more than 180 of them.
SarahBrown	validation	Jess Franco	Through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of 'The lion and the cucumber' ('Vampyros Lesbos OST'): ███████████ is an overwhelming director.
SarahBrown	validation	Vampiros	When the phone rang during '████████', I let it ring.
SarahBrown	validation	Franco	Since that moment ██████ never could grip me that much.
SarahBrown	validation	Franco	██████ is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera.
SarahBrown	validation	Godard	But then the story went on, puzzling and gripping, beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see ██████ do if he weren't so occupied with spreading his political messages.
SarahBrown	validation	Franco	Luckily the acting is good (something that can spoil a lot of ██████ movies for you, but not this one).
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie Murphy	I don't care if it's not the most well put-together movie of all time, the fact that it has ████████████ doing something non-formulaic, and that I don't know what will happen next, makes it a favorite of mine.
SarahBrown	validation	Preston	The Sundowners is a tightly-paced, gritty, and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Shane	Here, he comes across as an evil version of █████, that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw's relationship is revealed.
SarahBrown	validation	Pascualino De Santis	Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by ████████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Armando Trovajoly	Emotive musical score by █████████████████ with sensitive leitmotif.
SarahBrown	validation	Scola	Director █████'s imagination stretches to light up the limited scenarios where are developing the drama.
SarahBrown	validation	Bernard Rose	 Add to all this an incredibly talented director (████████████), imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you're ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why I have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express.
SarahBrown	validation	Suzy Kendall	████████████ will hold your interest throughout.
SarahBrown	validation	Russell	███████ was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity.
SarahBrown	validation	Ruby Keeler	This film reminds me of 42nd Street starring Bebe Daniels and ███████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Eloise	When I watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd Street, especially the character ██████ who's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle, like Bebe Daniels did in 42nd Street and another performer gets the part and become a star.
SarahBrown	validation	Micheaux	But its worth watching because it is good and ████████ does good with the little he has.
SarahBrown	validation	Micheaux	There's even white people watching the entertainment, I wonder where ████████ found them, there's even a scene where there's blacks and whites sitting together at the club, Micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films, he should be commended for such a bold move.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar Micheaux	This movie was the first race film I really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to ██████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Moon	There are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast, ████ Over Harlem, Body and Soul, Paradise
SarahBrown	validation	Sepia Cinderella	What A Girl, Mystery In Swing, Miracle In Harlem, and ████████████████, that not only has good entertainment but good acting.
SarahBrown	validation	Geraldine Fitzgerald	I have seen this film several times, and watched it today (on TCM) solely because of ████████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Lukas	The real star in this movie, however, is ██████████, and he deserved all the accolades he got.
SarahBrown	validation	Lukas	█████ did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation, and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do.
SarahBrown	validation	Hellman	It was something of an act of bravery for ███████ to write a play about good Germans at this time (maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the Nazi-Soviet pact!).
SarahBrown	validation	Rhein	In fact, Watch am █████ was a German army marching song - used in WWII, but the Nazis had their own marching song that was used as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Bodo	All the other actors did an excellent job here; although ████ was too much there are children like him.
SarahBrown	validation	Leo Genn	It is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues ████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Karloff	"In ""The Raven"" Lugosi is a sadistic surgeon, who blackmails ███████ to assist his evil plans until Karloff finally has had enough."
SarahBrown	validation	Rukh	And the radioactivity has affected ████'s brain.
SarahBrown	validation	Curie	Madame █████ had died recently from cancer she got due to work with Radium.
SarahBrown	validation	Rukh	"The wave of murders by ████ cause the newspapers to talk about a ""curse"" on the expedition."
SarahBrown	validation	Benet	On the other hand, █████ tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths, and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in England.
SarahBrown	validation	Lugosi	The film is good on many grounds, the most interesting that for a change Karloff and ██████ are not unsympathetic towards each other.
SarahBrown	validation	Ms Kemble Cooper	The other performances are good as well, in particular ████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Sherlock Holmes	Playing a high strung, distracted artistic type (a far cry from his more familiar roles as either menacing villains or the coolly logical ███████████████), Rathbone's character looks like he couldn't find his way out of bed without help.
SarahBrown	validation	Levant	""", to which ██████ responds, ""Ah, it's only a part-time job."""
SarahBrown	validation	Rathbone	Of course this goes right past (or over) ████████, who's too busy fretting about where his next hit song will come from.
SarahBrown	validation	Rathbone	As another reviewer said, who knew ████████ could be so funny!
SarahBrown	validation	Simba	My favorite part is when they show the pair raising █████.
SarahBrown	validation	Zazu	But why did they even include a voice actor for ████?
SarahBrown	validation	Bernard Rose	Well directed by ████████████ with a just beautiful music score and a few nice, scary jolts.
SarahBrown	validation	Burke	The only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is █████--she's not a very good actress (it's no surprise that this has been her only film) and it hurts the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Puss	His acting style fits the role very well as the devious, mischievous ████ who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan he's thought about seven or eight moves in advance.
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Walken	A fun film, and a must-see for anyone who enjoys the unique style of ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Zucker	I'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the ██████ movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around.
SarahBrown	validation	Adam Sandler	It's not like an ████████████ movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke.
SarahBrown	validation	Catherine Keener	████████████████ plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Julia Roberts	"She's not a ""10"" like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than █████████████ overdone overbite."
SarahBrown	validation	Ebert	This means you █████!!!
SarahBrown	validation	Gregory Peck	████████████ gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius as well as his egotism.
SarahBrown	validation	Douglas MacArthur	The whole story of █████████████████ would be a six hour film or a TV mini-series.
SarahBrown	validation	Herbert Hoover	It would also have to tell about him firing on the Bonus Marchers of World War I veterans in 1932, probably putting the final kabosh on any chances President ██████████████ had of getting re-elected.
SarahBrown	validation	Truman	The film takes him through his struggle to win back the Phillipines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by President ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	FDR	███ by O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd President.
SarahBrown	validation	Roosevelt	█████████ was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness.
SarahBrown	validation	Truman	Of course it's in the history books how ██████ relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination.
SarahBrown	validation	FDR	I've always felt that ███ would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president then.
SarahBrown	validation	Gregory Peck	MacArthur was also grandly eloquent and ████████████ captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield.
SarahBrown	validation	Peck	Listen to ████ at the Japanese surrender, at MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	Soldier may not have academy acting or █████ special effects but it definitely does it for me.
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt Russell	████████████ doesn't say much, he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	The chemistry between the actors (including little ██████) is amazing and thrilling.
SarahBrown	validation	Gilbert Markham	"And ███████████████ was amazingly ""on it"" from the very start of the movie."
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	But he outdoes himself here as ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur Huntingdon	In my wildest dreams I could not have pictured him playing a demented psycho such as █████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	glitxy	Its a throwback to the ██████,sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s..but with a modern touch.
SarahBrown	validation	Jordan	"To ""Bend It Like Beckham"" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to English sports fans, it is equivalent to ""Hit it Like Bonds"" or ""Dunk it Like ██████."""
SarahBrown	validation	Beckham	It Like ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Jess	████ loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother.
SarahBrown	validation	Jules	There is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when █████' mother thinks she's a lesbian.
SarahBrown	validation	Jess	The movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as ████' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light.
SarahBrown	validation	Beckham	It Like ███████ is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.
SarahBrown	validation	Tsui Hark	This is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind, █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Steven Chow's	It is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to █████████████ Shaolin Soccer.
SarahBrown	validation	Ekin Cheung	"There, comes a fine performance(as always) from ███████████ who plays ""Sky King""."
SarahBrown	validation	Louis Koo(Red	"He teams up with █████████████) who i was very impressed by his flexible ""wing"" which deflected incoming attacks."
SarahBrown	validation	Wu Xia	"Others who are famarialy with ""██████"" movies will have a better appoach."
SarahBrown	validation	Andrew Bergman	It's a well written screenplay by ██████████████ (Honeymoon In Vegas).
SarahBrown	validation	Tess Nanavati	█████████████ is clearly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films.
SarahBrown	validation	Elizbeth Von Arnim's	My mind was changed by ████████████████████ original book.
SarahBrown	validation	pre-Mussolini Italian	I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful █████████████████████ atmosphere.
SarahBrown	validation	Boccaccio	(Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from █████████'s Decameron on TV.)
SarahBrown	validation	Mike Newell	Great credit is due to the Director, ███████████, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies.
SarahBrown	validation	Mark Ruffalo	It had an amusing early performance from ████████████, and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies.
SarahBrown	validation	Ed Wood	We fans of ███████ tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place, but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan-dom that I have never before approached!
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie	"I remember how, as a teenager, I longed to see █████'s ""Revenge of the Dead"" (a.k.a."
SarahBrown	validation	Doris Wishman's	"Likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as ███████████████ ""A Night to Dismember"" or half the works of Jesus Franco!"
SarahBrown	validation	Fangoria	"And then, behold, there was ""I Woke Up Early the Day I Died"" - a movie that SHOULD have been so 'big', yet which disappeared into the ether even before ████████ printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite."
SarahBrown	validation	Ed Wood's	I think the German video, which I picked up while in Cologne on a cold crisp winter's day, is fairly well-known to █████████ followers now.
SarahBrown	validation	Ed Wood	Become obsessed - let ███████ rule your life.
SarahBrown	validation	Posey	█████ kept the movie afloat with her energy.
SarahBrown	validation	Dewey Decimal	But she learned the █████████████ system OVERNIGHT and then shelves tons of books to the beat of music??!!!!???
SarahBrown	validation	Posey	Worth seeing for █████ and Townsend
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie Murphys	█████████████ impressions are absolutely spot on.
SarahBrown	validation	James Brown	The best impression was of ███████████ and Mr T> SO FUNNY!!
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie Murphy	Its weird how ████████████ was back then and how he is now DELIRIOUS is a must see
SarahBrown	validation	Eddie Murphy	This is ████████████ at his prime and you can see where he got the humour and ideas of movies such as nutty professor from.
SarahBrown	validation	Haines	Bravo director Strick, screenwriter ██████, as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece.
SarahBrown	validation	Lewis Milestone	The film is wonderfully directed by ███████████████ (who also produced); the whole production feels like a labor of love.
SarahBrown	validation	Colman	There are wonderful touches, such as ██████ breaking frame and addressing the camera, and exceptional use of a sliding bar-cabinet door.
SarahBrown	validation	Cusack	As ██████ follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report, his skepticism is agitated.
SarahBrown	validation	Cusack	The narrative is told generally through the eyes of the ██████ character, a visionary from Louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him.
SarahBrown	validation	Aiello	The shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor's desk: a charge by ██████ for a subway stop and an off-ramp in Brooklyn to aid a new banking center, and the city's bid for the next Democratic convention.
SarahBrown	validation	Pappas	Much also is made of menschkeit, a Yiddish expression, which, ██████ explains to his deputy, is about the bond of honor between two men, about what happens between the two hands in a handshake.
SarahBrown	validation	Bridget Fonda	This connection doesn't mean much to █████████████, the lawyer for the policeman's association who defends the dead cop's honor and fights for his widow's pension even as incriminating evidence appears.
SarahBrown	validation	Pacino	But he goes anyway, and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole, ██████ and his character both.
SarahBrown	validation	Pacino	This is a script that knows it has to supply ██████ with the reason why most of his fans go to see him, and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech.
SarahBrown	validation	Pacino	██████ is innate with his down-to-earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination, inspired flair and matter-of-fact realism.
SarahBrown	validation	Cusack	██████ moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack O'Neil	 - The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no ███████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Jaffa	They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG-1 and human/█████ losing battle after battle to the Ori.
SarahBrown	validation	John Goodman	See if you can recognize ████████████ before he put on weight.
SarahBrown	validation	Frank Stanley	-- is, at times, obtrusively annoying, but the cinematography by █████████████ is knockout, particularly the mill scenes.
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	Having been first introduced to Park's work via ██████, I was curious to how he'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it.
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while ██████ and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vamp movies.
SarahBrown	validation	Tae-ju	Ah, but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen Father and his burgeoning lust for ██████ and conflict with duty as a priest.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	It won't spoil it if I tell you to watch ██████ from the mindset of a priest
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	Don't expect ██████ and stylization because that's not what you'll get here.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	After ██████, watch Let The Right One IN, it's also not what you'll expect either.
SarahBrown	validation	Goldie Hawn	Actually, ███████████ is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I digress.
SarahBrown	validation	Smith	This is sort of a Mr. █████ goes to Washington type of movie, with some variations but the same premise.
SarahBrown	validation	Goldie Hawn	I taped this movie off of cable years ago because I had a huge crush on ███████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Lion King	This is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first █████████, but that said, this was downright good.
SarahBrown	validation	Artemisia	This is a film about 17th Century Italian artists and one artist in particular, a woman █████████, an unheard of profession for females at that time, and she dared to paint the male nude detailing his unique musculature.
SarahBrown	validation	Tassi	After posing for her, █████ violently rapes her.
SarahBrown	validation	Artemisia	█████████ says she paints to please herself; her father paints to please others.
SarahBrown	validation	Billy Elliot	Rather ████████████ like I would say.
SarahBrown	validation	Sugiyama	 The humour was well timed, and the touching moments felt so real, you could feel the awkwardness between ████████ and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall.
SarahBrown	validation	Aoki	I loved ████ - him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl!
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	That was not the case when I watched ██████, under the American title Thirst.
SarahBrown	validation	George C. Scott	███████████████ may be American but he plays the part of the English miser with wonderful skill.
SarahBrown	validation	Vincent Price's	"Basically the exact same movie as ""House of Wax"" - ███████████████ first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares, because ""The Mad Magician"" offers just as many sheer thrills, delightful period set-pieces, joyous 3-D effects, sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor!"
SarahBrown	validation	Don Gallico	"███████████ is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as Gallico the Great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled ""The Girl and the Buzz Saw""."
SarahBrown	validation	Ross Ormond	Gallico's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ███████████ appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose, stating that all of Gallico's inventions are the rightful property of the company.
SarahBrown	validation	Alice Prentiss	"""The Mad Magician"" is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view, as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of ██████████████ is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era."
SarahBrown	validation	Vincent Price	Needless to state that █████████████ remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film, as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in.
SarahBrown	validation	Don Gallico	You pity ███████████, yet at the same time you fear him enormously.
SarahBrown	validation	Vincent Price	█████████████ simply was a genius actor and, in my humble opinion, the embodiment of the horror genre.
SarahBrown	validation	Henry Winkler	From the start of the film with █████████████ getting 'injured' on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter, laughter that lasted until the credits.
SarahBrown	validation	Henry Winkler	For those who love American wrestling this film is a must, but be ready to see █████████████ as you have never seen him before.
SarahBrown	validation	Max Von Sydow	█████████████ provides his great voice as the narrator.
SarahBrown	validation	Kelly	"Those who know who know the █████ ""legend"" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg."
SarahBrown	validation	Naomi Watt's	████████████ character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well.
SarahBrown	validation	Bob Chitty	██████████, a great footballer but a poor actor.
SarahBrown	validation	Bacchus Marsh	Some location shooting film in the area I live, █████████████ outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat.
SarahBrown	validation	Damian Szifron's	The admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation, because I'm watching the scenes of the film and I search inside my thoughts for film-making ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than ████████████████ mind.
SarahBrown	validation	Pablo Trapero	"Starting his journey from people's daily real lives, Szifron goes where █████████████ never could in ""El Bonaerense""; the Federal Police Department's life."
SarahBrown	validation	Luis Luque	The first character (██████████) is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him; and has to work on a case.
SarahBrown	validation	Díaz	"He wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins ████ in his routines: ""It's nothing, the usual stuff; no problem""."
SarahBrown	validation	Luis Luque	██████████ on the other hand, is back on track with a top-notch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is.
SarahBrown	validation	Christy	At the end, Dark Heart kidnap all the care bear & the kids (Dawn & John) have to tell ███████ that Dark Heart is evil.
SarahBrown	validation	Christy	Than Dark Heart saw ███████ got hit & stop fighting the care bear in order to help her
SarahBrown	validation	Christy	The care bears & the kids help Dark Heart save ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Christy	Now Dark Heart starting to care & became a real boy to fall in love with ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Christy	Dark Heart is now a real boy & help out ███████ to work out in camp.
SarahBrown	validation	Jason Bourne	████████████ will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity: he really killed some one who became his corpse.
SarahBrown	validation	Jason Bourne	Then the truth will come thanks to ████████████ himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the CIA is a woman and that woman gets the Senate involved in a general investigation.
SarahBrown	validation	Chris Walker	████████████
SarahBrown	validation	Anne Rice	█████████ is incredible and I ask myself, why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family and I'm not.
SarahBrown	validation	Julian	"Although the sardonic ██████ (ironically surnamed ""Noble"") appears to be a ""tough guy"" on the surface, underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities, a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless."
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	Playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being, ███████ is flip and cavalier one moment, then genuine and sympathetic the next.
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Shephard	This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director ████████████████, and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet.
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	"'The Matador"" is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will, hopefully, signal a new phase in ███████'s acting career."
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	"Again, it seems totally illogical, to me at least, that ""██████"" merits a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible."
SarahBrown	validation	Steve Gordon's	"██████████████ one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally ""unlikely"" if not quite ""impossible"" melding of wildly disparate elements."
SarahBrown	validation	Dudley Moore	That he gave ████████████ his finest role, and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact, including the score, seems to me patent and egregious.
SarahBrown	validation	John Gielgud	Even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization, and the late, sniffish Sir ████████████ was right about accepting his fee, but wrong about undertaking his role.
SarahBrown	validation	Hobson	It's obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during ██████'s longtime employment.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	The most interesting relationship in this film is not ██████'s romance at all, but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant.
SarahBrown	validation	Walken	One of ██████'s few musical roles to date.
SarahBrown	validation	Jason Connery	Also starring █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	███ is a kind of man-boy, who unfortunately has never really grown up, and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the Red Sox baseball team.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	███ has devoted his life to the Sox, and does everything from making the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	So ███ scrubs the toilet and the dog's teeth, while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed.
SarahBrown	validation	Lindsey	When ███████ wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch, she begins the long, fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	Having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle, ███ has organized his life around the season  he's never missed a game.
SarahBrown	validation	Lindsey	Can ███████ consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work?
SarahBrown	validation	Ben	Can she really accommodate ███'s infatuation with sports?
SarahBrown	validation	Mike Leonard	████████████ September 05.
SarahBrown	validation	Truman Capote	Last year we were treated to two movies about █████████████ writing the book from which this film was made - Capote and Infamous.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Blake	It is interesting that ████████████, who starred in this film, has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Pearl S Buck's	I first read ██████████████ splendid novel in my ninth grade history class, and I enjoyed every thrilling page of it.
SarahBrown	validation	Luise Rainer	Then there is ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar	Coming off an █████ win the previous year for her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the Viennese actress's star was on the rise and she was given the plum role of O-lan despite her lack of experience in Hollywood.
SarahBrown	validation	Oscar	Her performance won her a second consecutive █████, the first time in history that happened.
SarahBrown	validation	Wang Lung's	The film softens ███████████ marriage to O-lan somewhat.
SarahBrown	validation	Wang Lung	In the film, a contrite █████████ returns to his wife on her deathbed the two pearls he had taken from her years before, realizing too late that she was his true love.
SarahBrown	validation	Barry Van Dyke	He is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast, namely his real-life son, ██████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Victoria Rowell	███████████████ is also good, but I noticed that every series her hairstyle changes.
SarahBrown	validation	Bethany Cox	███████████
SarahBrown	validation	Lambert Hillyer	Director ███████████████ handled the complex story and story locations very well.
SarahBrown	validation	Lugosi	██████ likewise was correctly underplayed.
SarahBrown	validation	Agatha Christie	As I said there were so many good things: the African discovery of the Radium “X”, the melting of the stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the Ten Little Indians in And Then There Were None (███████████████)
SarahBrown	validation	Barry Fitzgerald	(the ████████████████ version)), the glowing of Karlof in the dark.
SarahBrown	validation	Violet Kemble Cooper	Karloff’s mother played by ████████████████████ with elegance.
SarahBrown	validation	Eva	The scene that touched me here is when Antwone finally saw his mother ███ face to face.
SarahBrown	validation	Eve	Adam was not so responsible for Eve's but this Adam(priest), sacrificial and responsible to pick ███ up from the Paradise Lost, vampire's world.
SarahBrown	validation	Ned Kelly'	'██████████ is a wonderfully made Australian film honouring a true Australian hero.
SarahBrown	validation	Ned Kelly	Some aspects of the film are fictional, and as an avid █████████ fan (and supporter), was slightly disappointed by this.
SarahBrown	validation	Kelly	Perhaps also the film could've gone longer, to cover more of the █████ Gang's/Ned's life - I felt not enough was covered.
SarahBrown	validation	Cross Eyed	Wow--Cross-Eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that I've watched in the past year, making it hard to believe that ██████████ is the writer's debut film.
SarahBrown	validation	Cross Eyed	I mean--I logged onto IMDb to find more films by this writer...because ██████████ has that unique signature --you want to see what else this writer might have to say.
SarahBrown	validation	Cross Eyed	For me--██████████ encapsulates what movie making should be about--combining the best of all film elements to create a clever, artistic and poignant tale.
SarahBrown	validation	Elinore Randall Stewart's	I also have █████████████████████████ homestead book.
SarahBrown	validation	Ed Furlong	Gotta start with ██████████ on this one.
SarahBrown	validation	God	███ bless this kid.
SarahBrown	validation	Furlong	You know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like ███████ is even acting.
SarahBrown	validation	Madsen	Same with ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Madsen	Does ██████ even have to act?
SarahBrown	validation	Mummy	Vosloo has obviously moved on from the type-casted █████ guy.
SarahBrown	validation	Jordana Spiro's	I think the biggest surprise to this film was ███████████████ performance.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne Ultimatum	"Think like ████████████████ ""lite"" style on some scenes in the café."
SarahBrown	validation	Moncia Dean	███████████?
SarahBrown	validation	Ashton Kutcher	██████████████ can act!
SarahBrown	validation	Trant	You will feel every emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the █████ family farm comes to a conclusion.
SarahBrown	validation	Orlando Bloom	The accents are impenetrable if you're from the US so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it, █████████████).
SarahBrown	validation	Ned Kelly	Some people have asked what happened to █████████ at the end of the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Bloch	Amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70's, and this, from leading horror scribe ████████████, is one of their best efforts.
SarahBrown	validation	Martin Stephens	"Franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since ███████████████ in ""The Innocents""."
SarahBrown	validation	Dominic	The brief shots of ███████ reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter Cushing's	The original poster art, featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding ███████████████ severed head, was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear.
SarahBrown	validation	Stepin Fetchit	The Old Mill Pond is more of a tribute to the African-American entertainers of the '30s than any denigration of the entire race (██████████████ caricature notwithstanding).
SarahBrown	validation	Fetchit	"Even the lazy, shiftless ███████ characterization gets an exciting workout here when he gets chased by a tiger as ""Hold That Tiger"" plays on the score."
SarahBrown	validation	Fernack	With the help of his acquaintance Inspector ███████ who has come down from New York, they help a daughter of a crime boss.
SarahBrown	validation	Saint	Not a bad █████ movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy	It was when █████ gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.
SarahBrown	validation	Fred	It was almost by accident that ████ ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front.
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy	Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, █████ had become a top mobster in New York City's underworld!
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy	"█████'s life of crime came full circle when Rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a ""Valentine Day"" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters."
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy	While on trial █████ came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together.
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy	But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for █████!
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy	It was then that █████ decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn't have the heart to do, for him!
SarahBrown	validation	Jack nicholson	██████████████ is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinema.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack	Then the father (████) becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel.
SarahBrown	validation	Kubricks	████████ direction is nothing short then perfect.
SarahBrown	validation	Kubrick	Is the red purposely put in by ███████?
SarahBrown	validation	Kubrick	This is a definitive ███████ classic and this is the third of his films I have given 10/10.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert DeNiro	You get to see a whole different side to █████████████ in this movie!
SarahBrown	validation	Whoopi Goldberg	███████████████ puts in a good performance here, but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character.
SarahBrown	validation	Sergio Martino	"After dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the masterful film ""The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh"" (1971), director ██████████████ followed up that same year with what turns out to be another twisty suspense thriller, ""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail."""
SarahBrown	validation	George Hilton	"Like his earlier effort, this one stars handsome macho dude █████████████, who would go on to star in Martino's Satanic/giallo hybrid ""All the Colors of the Dark"" the following year."
SarahBrown	validation	Edwige Fenech	I suppose █████████████ was busy the month they shot this!
SarahBrown	validation	Martino	Anyway, this film boasts the stylish direction that ███████ fans would expect, as well as a twisty plot, some finely done murder set pieces, and beautiful Athenian location shooting.
SarahBrown	validation	Farrah Fawcett's	The story this time concerns an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here looking like ████████████████ prettier, smarter sister) who become embroiled in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of $1 million by a beautiful widow.
SarahBrown	validation	Anita	Highlights of the picture, for me, were █████'s cat-and-mouse struggle with the killer at the end, a particularly suspenseful house break-in, and a nifty fight atop a tiled roof; lots of good action bursts in this movie!
SarahBrown	validation	Lars	████ continues the great combination of occult, dark horror and soap-opera drama.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars von Trier	A lot can be said about ██████████████... but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric.
SarahBrown	validation	Udo Kier	████████ solidifies his immense talent, to anyone who doubted it.
SarahBrown	validation	Helmer	██████'s solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof... from which he could see his beloved Sweden... to a bathroom.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars von Trier	I recommend this to any fan of ██████████████ and anyone who enjoyed the first Riget and wants more where that came from.
SarahBrown	validation	Soylent Green	█████████████ is a wild movie that I enjoyed very much.
SarahBrown	validation	Charleton Heston	It had likable characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a compelling and thought-provoking storyline, and the macho-est macho man out there: ████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Fleischer	█████████████████ gave the movie a very unpleasant, dirty feel.
SarahBrown	validation	Charleton Heston	████████████████, who has become one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn.
SarahBrown	validation	Neil Simon	It was written by ██████████ so its non-stop one-liners.
SarahBrown	validation	Burns	For me it's worth seeing for █████ alone.
SarahBrown	validation	Frank Morgan	████████████ gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears.
SarahBrown	validation	Absolutely Fabulous	This movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to ███████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Loy	███ is adorable as his pre-NOW wife.
SarahBrown	validation	Tarzan Lex Barker	The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future █████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	I did like how Admiral ███████ died for the Voyager crew.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	As fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having ███████ both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	I admit that the scenes of ███████ and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp.
SarahBrown	validation	Edward G. Robinson	"In this final movie for legendary actor, ██████████████████, ""Solent Green"" becomes a landmark classic."
SarahBrown	validation	Thorn	What █████ discovers marks him for death, but like the film, awaits a final warning.
SarahBrown	validation	music----came	I think all of the elements that make this series charming---the vintage '60s/'70s style cinematography, creepy to kooky, far-fetched tales and the utter Britishness of it all right down the backing █████████████ together better here than any of the others overall.
SarahBrown	validation	Dominic	He creates a murderous character called ███████ and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter Cushing	 The second story is the tale of a lonely old man (█████████████) that has moved here to escape his loneliness, yet it only worsens as he is haunted by lost love.
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Lee	The third story includes the great ███████████████ (my fav British horror actor) as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter.
SarahBrown	validation	Lee	███ is superb here as the ice cold disciplinarian, that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth!!
SarahBrown	validation	Ingrid Pitt	Not long after, the lovely ███████████, a costar on his movie set, came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight---but he needn't have bothered, for she was a real vampire herself.
SarahBrown	validation	Emile Ardolino	What a loss the passing of director ██████████████ was!
SarahBrown	validation	Cybill Shepherd	"The script is perfect for ███████████████, who at the time needed to capitalize on her ""Moonlighting"" success for the new generation who was (fortunately for her) probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start."
SarahBrown	validation	Mary Stuart Masterson	"In this film she's every bit back in form as a still-pining widow living vicariously through her daughter (█████████████████████ on the cusp of stardom which would peak with ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" two years later)."
SarahBrown	validation	Ardolino	Mr. ████████, your cinematic touch IS missed!
SarahBrown	validation	Fallon	But ██████ is the nice surprise in this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Fallon	██████ delivers his lines with subtle perfection.
SarahBrown	validation	Fallon	In short, a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs. female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot-on humorous lines, most delivered with brilliant subtlety by ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Chuck	█████ is adorable as is Olive.
SarahBrown	validation	Seuss	This is like Dr. █████ for adults.
SarahBrown	validation	Pierce Brosnan	The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by ██████████████ is alone worth the price of admission.
SarahBrown	validation	Greg Kinnear	"Add the kind-hearted, uber-likable American ""guy next door', ████████████, to set up contrast."
SarahBrown	validation	Davis	"Hope █████ is well cast as the ""gem of a wife""."
SarahBrown	validation	Vonnegut	"I am a huge fan of ████████'s work and I'm very fond of this movie, but I wouldn't say that this is a film of the ""Mother Night"" that I read."
SarahBrown	validation	Vonnegut	When people say that ████████ is unfilmable, two things come to my mind.
SarahBrown	validation	Vonnegut	"Amazing to think that an innocent piece like ████████'s ""Sirens of Titan"" would probably have been the equivalent of ""R"" rated if filmed when it was published back in the 50s, for its violence, language and sexual and thematic content, though it's a tragedy that nobody's come up yet with a filmable script for it."
SarahBrown	validation	Vonnegut	████████ suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work, himself as author/narrator.
SarahBrown	validation	Vonnegut	"As did another turkey made from a ████████ novel, ""Slapstick"" in an even more spectacular way."
SarahBrown	validation	Vonnegut	"Still, there's nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of ████████, and ""Mother Night"" is an excellent example of how, as another reviewer put it, a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this."
SarahBrown	validation	Vonnegut	"Also there was an interesting piece , if it still exists, done in the 70s called ""Between Time And Timbuktu"" which ████████ apparently didn't like much, although he was involved in its production, because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality."
SarahBrown	validation	Turturro	"""The Luzhin Defence"" is, in the foreground, a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant (████████) who becomes consumed by the game and, in the background via flashbacks, his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become."
SarahBrown	validation	Watson	"Factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest (██████) and former ""mentor"" (Wilson) respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of Italy's Lake Como and the intensity of high chess play."
SarahBrown	validation	Trier	The first von █████ movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves.
SarahBrown	validation	Jodie Foster	"████████████, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like ""a family"" (like the family unit she's never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't."
SarahBrown	validation	Scott Baio	Did we really need a long sequence with ██████████ outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard?
SarahBrown	validation	Baio	"Or an even longer sequence--also with ████--where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the ""pain of illusion""."
SarahBrown	validation	Jodie	And █████'s face at the ending speaks volumes.
SarahBrown	validation	Macbeth	This is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a NY production of ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Macbeth	Although it has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the themes of ███████) in our modern world, the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously.
SarahBrown	validation	Shakespeare	Probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre, but anyone who enjoys ███████████ should enjoy this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Lady Tremain	"You really ""hated"" ████████████ and the step-sisters; they were just awful."
SarahBrown	validation	Will Smith	"Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring ██████████."
SarahBrown	validation	Sophie Fiennes'	Slavoj iek is both a narrator and a subject of ███████████████ extraordinary new film, A Pervert's Guide to the Cinema.
SarahBrown	validation	Astra Taylor	In a documentary by ████████████ (iek!, 05), Slovenian philosopher at one point confessed his fear of being silent.
SarahBrown	validation	Chaplin	Well, for example he sees ███████'s reluctance towards talking picture as a sign of an universal fear of voice itself (kind of alien force taking over the human being  think the ventriloquist segment of Dead of Night [45]).
SarahBrown	validation	Fiennes	The question isn't whether iek is inspiring and brilliant, because he is; or whether ███████ film is worth watching, because it is likewise.
SarahBrown	validation	Vertigo	For example: while considering ███████ (58) iek states that what's hidden behind human face is a perfect void, which makes face itself only a facade: something of a deception in its own means.
SarahBrown	validation	Mitch	"The film has all the virtues of a splendid two-and-a-half hours lecture: lots of ground are covered, many perspectives employed, even some first-rate wisecracks made (when iek travels on a Melanie Daniels' boat from The Birds [63] and tries to think as she did, he comes up with: ""I want to f**k █████!"")."
SarahBrown	validation	John Mourby	My name is ███████████ and this is my story about Paperhouse:
SarahBrown	validation	Alfred Hitchcock's	In May 2003 I saw ██████████████████ psycho, I was very scared and deeply disturbed.
SarahBrown	validation	Marianne Dreams	Paperhouse is based on a favourite book that I own, called ███████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Anna	One day in school ████ draws a house in her scrap book (nothing remarkable about that) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house (and I mean genuinely unnerving).
SarahBrown	validation	Anna	████ draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world.
SarahBrown	validation	Anna	So ████ decides to draw her father in.
SarahBrown	validation	Anna	she gets her pencil out and gets too work, but the outcome is deformed and unsettling ████ particularly dislikes his eyes.
SarahBrown	validation	Anna	So ████ tries to rub him out and start again, but the pencil proves indelible (that means nothing can be rubbed out).
SarahBrown	validation	Anna	Then ████ loses her temper and crosses out her father's eyes!
SarahBrown	validation	Hoo	███ boy, does Ultimatum have suspense!
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	Even when you know ██████ will escape the authorities (and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept), it's still brilliant watching him do it.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Greengrass	Chalk it up to ███████████████, who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary, even though he's filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like CIA headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder.
SarahBrown	validation	Ultimatum	This longing of his for a real life could get boring, and almost did in Supremacy, but just works better in █████████ (better script).
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	██████ regrets all the people he killed, and he considers (or at least made me consider) the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning, and how the government has transformed men into resources.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne	Sidenote: it's always bothered me that, despite being a superspy and hunted by the CIA, Interpol, and the police nearly ANYWHERE he goes, that ██████ never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne Ultimatum	 If you have a pulse and love action movies, than ████████████████ is for you.
SarahBrown	validation	John Scott Shepard	The first episode, which is going to sound a bit stupid since ██████████████████ has created this situation - both the sister and mother gets pregnant.
SarahBrown	validation	Charton Heston	Its time to pay tribute to the great ██████████████ after his recent passing but this film is not the one.
SarahBrown	validation	BEN HUR	His other films of a past generation were ███████, THE TEN COMMANDENTS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his better works.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlton Heston's	█████████████████ character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalism.
SarahBrown	validation	Edward G. Robinson	The film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great ██████████████████ but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlton Heston	This is a dud of a film and I wouldn't even recommend it to baby boomers or ███████████████ fans.
SarahBrown	validation	Anthony Mann's	In many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of ██████████████ Westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way.
SarahBrown	validation	Taylor	Raised by Indians, he's fully aware of the damage he's doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction, and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self-loathing as ██████ is with hate.
SarahBrown	validation	Granger	███████'s accent isn't always convincing, but he makes a good quiet hero in the Jimmy Stewart mold, trying to keep hold of his newfound decency and reconcile his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make amends.
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Dean Anderson 2	███████████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Amanda Tapping	██████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	O'Neill	RDA gives his '███████' character believable personality.
SarahBrown	validation	O'Neill	Yet '███████'s' tactical instincts always seem sound.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben Browder	███████████ was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show.
SarahBrown	validation	Claudia Black	He had his rare moments with █████████████, but that was all.
SarahBrown	validation	Amanda Tapping	██████████████ was phoning in her performances these two seasons.
SarahBrown	validation	Amanda Tapping	Maybe ██████████████ can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season.
SarahBrown	validation	Daniel Jackson'	In the season 2 opener, '███████████████ is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded.
SarahBrown	validation	Frasier	This device could have been used in several later episodes on 'Daniel', 'O'Neill', and 'Dr. ███████'.
SarahBrown	validation	Jodie Foster	████████████ plays her character straight out.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeanie	██████ and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand.
SarahBrown	validation	Agustí Villaronga	"Like his earlier film, ""In a Glass Cage"", █████████████████ achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor."
SarahBrown	validation	Pakeezah	Perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all Indian films - ████████ does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with Bollywood film (ie tackiness, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themes/genres).
SarahBrown	validation	Pakeezah	████████ is indigenous to the Sub-Continent and authentic, almost Madam Butterfly-like in plot.
SarahBrown	validation	Pakeezah	The Urdu-speaking milieux at the time of ████████ were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age!
SarahBrown	validation	Pakeezah	████████ is surely the pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled.
SarahBrown	validation	Parker	For those who haven't noticed yet, ██████ and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics.
SarahBrown	validation	Vader	I loved the duel between █████ and Luke which is the best of the saga.
SarahBrown	validation	Vader	The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When █████ turns on the Emperor.
SarahBrown	validation	John William's	And as always the ██████████████ music will bring the classicism into Star Wars universe.
SarahBrown	validation	Harris	██████ takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary.
SarahBrown	validation	Harris	The third and final installment to the trilogy is truly amazing for ██████' extreme sensitivity with the subject.
SarahBrown	validation	Gary	"Unlike the second installment, ""The Orkly Kid"" shows ████ as a truly troubled character."
SarahBrown	validation	Olivia Newton	His secret passion for dressing like █████████████ John distances him even further from the people that already consider him a social outcast.
SarahBrown	validation	Gary	Surely, one can see ████ as a ridiculously pathetic character, but may also identify with him as an outcast.
SarahBrown	validation	Wrestlemania	This might be the WWE's 2nd best PPV of the year after ████████████ it was a good suprise!
SarahBrown	validation	Dudley	Bubba & Spike ██████ won a fairly violent tables match over Benoit & Guerrero.
SarahBrown	validation	Brock	RVD and █████ had the match of the night it was filled with great high spots and RVD got to retain his ic title through a DQ
SarahBrown	validation	Eric Bischoff	Triple H also signed with █████████████ and Raw which means little to nothing.
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt Angle & Undertaker	And in the main event the Rock became the first ever 7-time WWE world champion defeating both ███████████████████████ in a triple threat match.
SarahBrown	validation	Beckham	It Like ███████ (2002) almost scene for scene.
SarahBrown	validation	the Kung Fu	A nice feature the serves as the backbone of the movie is the progression of fights with the mysterious ninja under the highway, beginning with miserable losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a win against oneself, as ███████████ master stressed several times.
SarahBrown	validation	Brian Krause's	Although the camera work is lacking, ██████████████ character is annoying, and the plot is clique, it's much more funnier than the first and that is what I find entertaining about it.
SarahBrown	validation	Lee Marvin	"I immediately recognized it as a sendup of the opening credits of ""M-Squad"" starring ██████████, one of my all-time favorite cop shows."
SarahBrown	validation	Georg Stanford Brown	"Then came ""special guest star"" ████████████████████ getting flattened by a plummeting safe."
SarahBrown	validation	Muhammed Ali	"The episode was ""Ring of Fear/A Dangerous Assignment"", with its comic references to ""On The Waterfront"", and ""████████████"", but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non sequiturs."
SarahBrown	validation	William Powell	The unflappable ██████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Powell	There are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and ██████ is a master at this.
SarahBrown	validation	Bryan Fuller	It is wonderfully thought up, and ████████████ has the most remarkable ideas for this show.
SarahBrown	validation	Scrubs	It is a huge relief to see a show, that is unlike the rest, where as, if you compared it to some of the newer shows, such as ██████ and House, you would see the similarities, and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter Cushing	This one features █████████████ and was probably my favorite of the bunch.
SarahBrown	validation	Christopher Lee	The third story starts out rather good and features ███████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Cushing	Though I was not very satisfied with the explanation as I don't think it really explained ███████'s story much at all.
SarahBrown	validation	Paul Anderson	"I even think that this is the best work I've seen from director █████████████, who has previously directed the entertaining ""Mortal Kombat"" and the not so entertaining ""Event Horizon""."
SarahBrown	validation	John Denver	I am a huge ███████████ fan.
SarahBrown	validation	Tarantino	I really, truly believe I was part of a happening, like reading a █████████ script before any else did or seeing the first screening of Mean Streets.
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver	██████!
SarahBrown	validation	Carol Reed	In this rendition of the timeless classic novel turned stage musical, director ██████████ brings the Broadway hit to life on the movie screen.
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver	Our story takes place in jolly old England where a boy named ██████ manages to work his way out of the orphanage.
SarahBrown	validation	Fagin	The leader of this gang is named █████, an older fellow who sells all the stolen goods.
SarahBrown	validation	Oliver	██████!
SarahBrown	validation	movie,,with	Of course with your typical love/comedy movie,,there's a long moment in the ███████████ i'm in love and what do I do,,but
SarahBrown	validation	Marion Davies	█████████████ could act, given the right property; she is wonderful in comedic roles.
SarahBrown	validation	William Haines	██████████████ could act, and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular leading men.
SarahBrown	validation	Vidor	King █████'s direction is one of the principle reasons for this.
SarahBrown	validation	Irving Thalberg	The boy genius, ███████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Charlie Chaplin	You get to see (briefly) some of the major stars of the day; even ███████████████ does a turn as himself, seeking an autograph.
SarahBrown	validation	Klingon	In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots the Klingon Klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the ███████ is sent to the Starfleet Hospital.
SarahBrown	validation	Soval	The Vulcan ambassador █████ proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of Klaang to his warrior empire in planet Kronos with honor.
SarahBrown	validation	Jonathan Archer	However, Captain ███████████████ proposes to go with the Enterprise in her first voyage and bring back Klaang alive to his home planet.
SarahBrown	validation	T'Pol	█████ modifies the sensors of the Enterprise to track the Suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet Riger X.
SarahBrown	validation	Whooo Whooo	███████████!
SarahBrown	validation	Rip Torn	Performances by ████████ and Conchata Farrell were superb, photography excellent, moving story line and everything else about it was of the highest standard.
SarahBrown	validation	Alice Cooper	First and foremost, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by such artists as ████████████ and the Velvet Underground in addition to the infectious non-stop assortment of Ramones songs.
SarahBrown	validation	Sheena	"""Teenage Lobotomy"", ""██████ is a Punk Rocker"", and ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" are just a few of them."
SarahBrown	validation	Allan Arkush	The energy level is high, with co-story author and director ████████████ bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings.
SarahBrown	validation	Rob Bottin	There are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects notable ██████████, in one of his earliest gigs.
SarahBrown	validation	Roger Corman	This movie was released by ████████████, so you know that the filmmakers didn't have much money to work with.
SarahBrown	validation	Justine Priestley	AMANDA, as played by the obviously talented █████████████████, is a complex character.
SarahBrown	validation	Amanda	Surprisingly, ██████ redeems herself at the end with an act of love, where most of these movies turn into the typical, all out fight to the death and the evil character dies just as evil in the end as to begin with.
SarahBrown	validation	Jerry	He called █████, his butler, `Alfred'.
SarahBrown	validation	Shakespeare	He opens a bust of ███████████ in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage.
SarahBrown	validation	Burt Ward	When the Batmobile is stolen he not only believes it's his duty as a crime fighter to recover it, he drags and unwilling █████████ in as his assistant.
SarahBrown	validation	Jim Carey	Gorshin will be the Riddler when █████████, his obvious successor, is long forgotten.
SarahBrown	validation	Alistair Sim	The ████████████ classic, 'Green For Danger', works because it pushes the form almost into parody, while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery.
SarahBrown	validation	Michael Curtiz's	Before that came ████████████████ brilliant 'The Kennel Murder Case'.
SarahBrown	validation	Philo Vance	It is up to ███████████, gentleman and amateur detective, neither old nor fat, to read the clues more insightfully, open the case out of the confines of the room, and eventually solve the case, the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual stimulation.
SarahBrown	validation	Vance	There isn't even really an attempt to 'subvert' the image of the perfect detective - there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect, with no protest from █████, but that's about it.
SarahBrown	validation	Gary Marshalls	██████████████ lines are a riot....this is what I love about good comedies.
SarahBrown	validation	Pakeezah	████████ is in my mind the greatest achievement of Indian cinema.
SarahBrown	validation	Paget Brewster	Also, on a personal note, ██████████████ is beautiful in this movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Kes	The past few months I have collected Voyager seasons 4 to 7 on DVD (I only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because ███ is my favourite character) and have just reached the end.
SarahBrown	validation	Harry	█████ has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important.
SarahBrown	validation	Joe	The Doctor, in the future, is well respected by all and finally chooses the name ███!
SarahBrown	validation	Alice Krige	███████████ plays the Borg Queen again fantastically, just her voice and acting method are magnificent.
SarahBrown	validation	Susanna Thompson	I feel sorry for ████████████████ though, the TV Borg queen replaced by the movie Borg queen.
SarahBrown	validation	Trojan	And what a wonderful idea to get inside a Borg sphere for protection, on the DVD special features they say it was like the ██████ horse.
SarahBrown	validation	Naomi Wildman	When █████████████ was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely.
SarahBrown	validation	Chakotay	████████ became my least favourite character.
SarahBrown	validation	Janeway	Gone was the chemistry with ███████ (will they/won't they?)
SarahBrown	validation	Harry	█████ was annoying at times but a okay character at other times.
SarahBrown	validation	Jamie Foxx	I had no expectations; I'd never heard of ██████████; all I knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it.
SarahBrown	validation	Foxx	To me, ████ is an original.
SarahBrown	validation	David Morse	███████████ is terrific (true, this is not his finest role).
SarahBrown	validation	Loretta Castorini	█████████████████ (Cher)is a woman in her late thirties, a widow, who lives with her parents in a duplex apartment in Brooklyn.
SarahBrown	validation	John Patrick Shanley	The setup is pure sitcom, but the story, written by ████████████████████ with a deep understanding for Italian-Americans living in New York, is genuine: he gets the idiosyncrasies of these people and their day-to-day foibles and quirks, and all of the characters have a deep romanticism that comes through in key moments throughout the story.
SarahBrown	validation	Reese Witherspoon	I think █████████████████ was a great actress even in this film, her debut, and this is definitely worth watching!
SarahBrown	validation	Witherspoon	Most women can definitely relate to everything-from ███████████'s words, her subtle glances, and her not so subtle emotions (raging like the typical teenage girl).
SarahBrown	validation	Shakespeare	Hamlet is by far my favorite of all of ███████████'s works.
SarahBrown	validation	Branaugh	████████ is one heck of an actor.
SarahBrown	validation	Shakespeare	I recommend this to anyone both fan of ███████████ and those not so much.
SarahBrown	validation	Mel Gibson's	Not to knock ████████████ version, but Branaughs touches the whole work.
SarahBrown	validation	Phil	I also appreciated the absence of Dr. ████ psychobabble or New Age revisionism.
SarahBrown	validation	Wyeth	The sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of █████ paintings and amazingly effective.
SarahBrown	validation	Philo Vance	███████████, hearing of the situation while about to set off for Italy, decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and what everyone else is considering a suicide.
SarahBrown	validation	Etienne Girardot	Add into the mix a wonderfully comedic turn by ████████████████ as a public coroner always missing his meal.
SarahBrown	validation	Jaffa	At the same time, they forged alliances with the Asgard, the Tok'ra, the rebel █████, the Nox and the Tollan.
SarahBrown	validation	Michael Shanks	██████████████ left the series in January 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor.
SarahBrown	validation	Don S. Davis	████████████ left the series at the end of the seventh season in March 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go.
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Dean Anderson	The show's original star and arguably its most popular actor, █████████████████████, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack O'Neill	████████████ was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason.
SarahBrown	validation	Barbara Bouchet	Kitty (███████████████) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer.
SarahBrown	validation	Marina Malfatti	Is it Franziska (███████████████)?
SarahBrown	validation	Evelyn	Is it ██████ back from death for revenge?
SarahBrown	validation	Emilio Miraglia	The color is superb in this thriller from ███████████████, who only did one other Giallo, as far as I know.
SarahBrown	validation	Carell	"You can tell that Will Ferrell influenced his ""comedic air"" but ██████ takes it to another level, everything he does is innocent, lovable, and hilarious."
SarahBrown	validation	Steve Carell	I would not hesitate to say that ████████████ is one of the next great comedians of our time.
SarahBrown	validation	Anchorman	Filled with sex jokes, some nudity, and a lot of language, this movie isn't for everyone but if you liked the Wedding Crashers, █████████, or any movie along those lines, you will absolutely love The 40 Year Old Virgin.
SarahBrown	validation	Welles	I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent in which devious Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several ██████ movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does.
SarahBrown	validation	von Trier	After Zentropa, █████████ moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary, over-rated, un-nuanced sap like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
SarahBrown	validation	YouTube	This a Casper the Friendly Ghost short from my childhood, and I re-watch it on ███████ (Thank GOD!
SarahBrown	validation	Frank Gallop's	I love how the short starts off spooky with ██████████████ haunting narration; until we get to see Casper sitting by his tombstone in the cemetery, reading.
SarahBrown	validation	Casper	Poor ██████ sat on a log and weep; until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him.
SarahBrown	validation	Ferdie	Casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub ██████ and considers him to be his very best friend.
SarahBrown	validation	Ferdie	Casper yells to ██████ that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine.
SarahBrown	validation	Ferdie	But Casper sees ██████'s body is not moving and asks if he is OK.
SarahBrown	validation	Ferdie	"When Casper sees ██████ has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost ""the only friend he ever had in his whole life."""
SarahBrown	validation	Ferdie	Casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that ██████ has resurrected as a ghost himself.
SarahBrown	validation	Ferdie	Casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Heath Ledger	How could I possibly pass up the chance to see Orlando Bloom and ████████████ together?
SarahBrown	validation	Ned Kelly	I had never heard of █████████ and was surprised by what I found out about this young man's legend.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	Depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on ████ and gratuitous nudity for it's thrills.
SarahBrown	validation	Waxworks	The second story, '████████,' has fine acting and it's moments, but is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense.
SarahBrown	validation	Dudley Moore	████████████ is fantastic in this largley unknown classic.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	The character ██████ is hilarious, with his drunken comments.
SarahBrown	validation	Farrelly	I love and admire the ████████ brothers!
SarahBrown	validation	Big Time	████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Farrelly	I think that the ████████ brothers movies are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they're deeeeeep!
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt Russell	The fact that ████████████ stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant.
SarahBrown	validation	Gary Busey	Not really sure if ██████████ and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not.
SarahBrown	validation	Kurt Russell	████████████ is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!).
SarahBrown	validation	Sean Pertwee	████████████ has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci-Fi lineage.
SarahBrown	validation	Cooper	Indeed its Quinns character who informs ██████ of the massacre of Custer told in flash back, the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the American west with American history.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	██████ is middle aged rich 'kid' who drinks like a fish.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	██████ does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	I watched this film because a very famous Indian film 'Sharabee' is based on the character of ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by '██████' I think they are two different films.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	'██████' is just fun.
SarahBrown	validation	Arthur	My favorite scene is when ██████ meets his fiancé's father and he keeps talking about the 'moose'.
SarahBrown	validation	Duddley Moore	█████████████ sure has some comic timing.
SarahBrown	validation	P.S. Would	██████████ someone please put this out on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS anymore.
SarahBrown	validation	Dani	I wanted to know what happened to ████ and her family.
SarahBrown	validation	Sean	its the first movie i ever ████ were the bad guys win and its a very good ending.
SarahBrown	validation	tels Luke	and i Will never ever forget the part were wader █████████ he is his father.way too cool.
SarahBrown	validation	Bob	also love the ███ feat figure
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	thanks █████
SarahBrown	validation	Polly Walker	The movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the scenery is beautiful (as is ████████████), and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying.
SarahBrown	validation	Bodo	Even the characters name (████) is funny.
SarahBrown	validation	Julie	█████ demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays.
SarahBrown	validation	Blake Edwards	█████████████ shot the film in Ireland and authentic WW I -type planes were used in the film.
SarahBrown	validation	Janos Rukh/Boris Karloff's	██████████████████████████ science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena.
SarahBrown	validation	Rukh/Karloff	When ████████████ is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity viewed on film (only visible, as in a movie theater, when the lights are out).
SarahBrown	validation	Bernard Rose	Little seen multi-genre flick from director ████████████ (Candyman, Immortal Beloved).
SarahBrown	validation	Angie Dickinson	It is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty ███████████████ as a saloon girl.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Mitchum	██████████████ comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer, but people are worried that he will go too far, also about the harm that he will do to the town´s businesses.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack Cardiff	"""A Matter of Life and Death"" has a brilliant cinematography by ████████████, a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera."
SarahBrown	validation	Niven	This film marked one of the highlights in Mr. █████'s career.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter	As fate would have it, █████ and June fall in love at first sight.
SarahBrown	validation	Marius Goring	An excellent star turn by █████████████, who as the Conductor 71 steals the film.
SarahBrown	validation	Goring	Mr. ██████, who had worked with the directors, is one of the best things in the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Rita Hayworth	█████████████ was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous.
SarahBrown	validation	Rita Hayworth	Although a musical, I thought █████████████ did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Rita	████ wants to be a cover girl for a magazine
SarahBrown	validation	Gene Kelly	but she's also in love with her mentor played by ██████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Kelly	Does she leave █████ to fulfill her dream and bypass love and Broadway stardom
SarahBrown	validation	PJ Soles	I've never been a fan of ████████ and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who the Ramones were until she filmed this movie, but I can ignore her snarly little face for the most part.
SarahBrown	validation	PJ Soles	The special edition DVD has a good retrospective, surprisingly ████████ isn't on it.
SarahBrown	validation	Taro Yamamoto's	On a side note, ███████████████ performance was very surprising.
SarahBrown	validation	Shogo Kawada	The only other film I've seen him in is Battle Royale, where he plays ████████████, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo.
SarahBrown	validation	Toshi	█████ is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyde	That ████'s character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene.
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy Fallon's	It was really funny, and I think it was ██████████████ best performance.
SarahBrown	validation	William H. Macy	███████████████ is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents.
SarahBrown	validation	Brommel	"Treads much of the same territory as TV's ""The Sopranos"" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from ███████ (I look forward to what this guy directs next), an excellent script, and all around great performances."
SarahBrown	validation	Donald Sutherland	█████████████████ is at his creepy best as the domineering father.
SarahBrown	validation	Tracy Ullman	████████████ gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as Macy's wife.
SarahBrown	validation	David Dorfman	Young █████████████ is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful).
SarahBrown	validation	Neve Campell	Even ████████████ (who I usually find abhorrent) is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Louis Stevenson	First of all, 'St. Ives' the film is only fairly loosely based on the ██████████████████████ story of the same name, but for once, this is not a criticism.
SarahBrown	validation	Stevenson	The original novel was a work-in-progress, unfinished at the author's death, and in freely adapting it and giving it an ending, the film-makers have brought to life some endearing characters who, although different from █████████'s originals, would, I am sure, have charmed and amused him.
SarahBrown	validation	Capitaine Jacques de Kéroual de Saint-Yves	It is 1813: ██████████████████████████████████████████ is a Breton aristocrat, orphaned by the Revolution's guillotine, now serving as a hussar in Napoleon's army.
SarahBrown	validation	Peepers	"The 100 black and white half-hour episodes of the early situation comedy ""Mr. ███████"" were originally broadcast from 1952-55 on NBC."
SarahBrown	validation	Peepers	"""Mr. ███████"" is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value."
SarahBrown	validation	Peepers	" ""Mr. ███████"", which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained tone, may appear slow and dull in comparison."
SarahBrown	validation	Fred Coe	"Credit should be give to the show's producer, ████████, a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out (""Philco Television Playhouse"", ""Lights Out"", ""Playhouse 90"", ""Producers Showcase"", ""Playwrights 56"", ""Fireside Theatre"", etc.) even on kinescope."
SarahBrown	validation	Cox	 The series provided ███ with an outstanding supporting cast.
SarahBrown	validation	Citizen Kane	It's a classic that really does rank right up there with Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, Gone With the Wind, ████████████, & Chariots of Fire.
SarahBrown	validation	Fantasia	There IS hope -- 1940's ████████ wasn't a hit 'til the '60s, & the Wizard of Oz was a dud at the box office, but made a hit by TV.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter Bogdonavich	█████████████████ has made a handful of truly great films, and THEY ALL LAUGHED is one of his best.
SarahBrown	validation	Robby Muller's	██████████████ camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental, but surely isn't.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars Von Trier's	More eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of ████████████████ fantastic horror satire The Kingdom...
SarahBrown	validation	Udo Kier	Plus a great performance from ████████ in a more substantial role...
SarahBrown	validation	Debra Winger's	Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not just for ██████████████ affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers.
SarahBrown	validation	Andy Stitzer	The 40 Year Old Virgin, is about ████████████, a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and doesn't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women.
SarahBrown	validation	Andy	Some of his co-workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that ████, is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity.
SarahBrown	validation	Steve Carell	The film stars and is co-written by ████████████, who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too.
SarahBrown	testing	Bruno Nicolai	It also has a very catchy score just for good measure by █████████████ that will stay in your head for a while
SarahBrown	testing	Audiard	Gesture is in particular beautifully observed in ███████'s filming.
SarahBrown	testing	Emmanuelle Devos	████████████████ should be nominated at the Best Actess Cesar Awards for her magistral play.
SarahBrown	testing	Dumbo	"I wanted ""█████,"" but my sisters won out, and we got ""Cinderella."""
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why ██████████ was trapped in such a horrible predicament.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	I wasn't too sympathetic to ██████████, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella Castle	I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring █████████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like ██████████ that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about.
SarahBrown	testing	Kirk	It's odd that no animal life, even insects, seems to exist here (how are flowers pollinated, for example), but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past (████ has a people-heavy past, it turns out), as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories.
SarahBrown	testing	Sulu	████ even finds an old-style police revolver (adding to his collection of swords, no doubt).
SarahBrown	testing	Kirk	It's almost whimsical, following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as ████ was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue (the Enterprise had, it's suggested, just completed a harrowing mission).
SarahBrown	testing	McCoy	█████ really is dead for all intents and purposes and, like the best Trek episodes, the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic, more desperate tempo of action and suspense.
SarahBrown	testing	McCoy	Perhaps this explains why this █████ was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with Data.
SarahBrown	testing	Judd Nelson's	What really makes this movie work is █████████████ character and the sometimes clever script.
SarahBrown	testing	Judd Nelson's	It was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch █████████████ Stanley doing what he does best.
SarahBrown	testing	Zippo	Captain █████ died in the great charge of the Buick.
SarahBrown	testing	The Jack Nicholson	██████████████████ impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket.
SarahBrown	testing	Sergio Leone's	"Yet another remake of ""Fistful of Dollars"", ██████████████ remake of Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" (suggested by the novel 'Red Harvest')."
SarahBrown	testing	Leone	The weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the 'fistful'/'yojimbo' plot to a sub-plot from █████'s 'Once Upon a Time in the West'.
SarahBrown	testing	leone	Although █████ directed both 'Fistful' and 'West', his motivations behind the two films couldn't be anymore different.
SarahBrown	testing	Eastwood	The 'Man With No Name' (████████) is a borderline socio-path with a soft spot for broken families.
SarahBrown	testing	Chaeles Bronson	Harmonica (███████████████) is obsessed with his own broken family, and obsessed with revenge.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie Got	The Part Where ███████████ Killed By Carface Was So Unforgivable.
SarahBrown	testing	Saddam Hussein	It is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither ██████████████ nor the people of Iraq, God rest the souls of the 350,000 plus that have been killed, had anything to do with terrorism nor al-Quida.
SarahBrown	testing	Bush	This movie is available free on the internet, until the ████ cabal locks it down, by googling-up the very title, as indicated in parenthesis.
SarahBrown	testing	Downey	Another ██████ must-see!
SarahBrown	testing	Alex Finch	He plays ██████████, a 22 year old Yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier.
SarahBrown	testing	Louie	█████ is killed on their one-year anniversary when he is hit by a car.
SarahBrown	testing	Alex Finch	He demands to go back, only this time in the body of ██████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Robert Downey Jr.	Enter █████████████████, a lot of confusion, and a lot of laughs.
SarahBrown	testing	Downey	It is a riot, and ██████ looks SO GOOD in a tuxedo.
SarahBrown	testing	Kevin Costner	█████████████ is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit.
SarahBrown	testing	Ashton Kutcher's	However, I was most impressed by ████████████████ performance.
SarahBrown	testing	Costner	This doesn't make sense: If she knows the layout so well, ███████ is right, he *should* be the one to leave.
SarahBrown	testing	Quincy Jones'	This film captured my heart from the very beginning, when hearing █████████████ first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows.
SarahBrown	testing	Spielberg	The whole cast gives the best performance in a film I've seen in years and █████████ has really outdone himself!
SarahBrown	testing	Danny Glover	The always sympathetic, charming ████████████ makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music
SarahBrown	testing	Jones	say sir)Quincy █████ adds even more beauty to this splendid film!
SarahBrown	testing	Henry Winkler	█████████████ is funny and sometimes sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is creatively.
SarahBrown	testing	Fonz	A great way to separate himself The ████ character he played on Happy Days at the time.
SarahBrown	testing	Quincy Jones'	Acting, script, █████████████ score, cinematography, editing, etc. -- just fantastic.
SarahBrown	testing	John Forsythe	Leading the investigation is █████████████, but the other three detectives are great as well.
SarahBrown	testing	Mano	 Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations -- the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, ████ a Mano.
SarahBrown	testing	Glengarry Glen Ross	Think ███████████████████ without the showboating.
SarahBrown	testing	Mikhali Cacoyannis	With Iphigenia, ██████████████████ is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient Greek theatre to the screen.
SarahBrown	testing	Euripides	His own screenplay, an adaptation of █████████' tragedy, was far from easy, compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed.
SarahBrown	testing	Euripides	The story has been very carefully deconstructed from █████████' version and placed in a logical, strictly chronological framework, better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story-telling.
SarahBrown	testing	Euripides	Cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in █████████' tragedy: Odysseus, Calchas, and the army.
SarahBrown	testing	Euripides	This was done in order to make some of █████████' points regarding war, the Church, and Government clearer.
SarahBrown	testing	Euripides	Finally, Cacoyannis' Iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to █████████'.
SarahBrown	testing	Giorgos Arvanitis	The director of photography, █████████████████, shows us a rugged but beautiful Greece, where since the Homeric days time seems to have stood still.
SarahBrown	testing	Agamemnon	In particular, the film's opening, with a bold, accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats, followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach, is a very effective means of communicating █████████'s awesome political and military responsibility.
SarahBrown	testing	Kazakos	███████ and Papas embody the sublimity of the classical Greece tragedy.
SarahBrown	testing	Irene Papas	███████████ is the modern quintessence of classic Greek plays.
SarahBrown	testing	Agamemnon	█████████'s quarters resembles a barn, he dresses, as do the others, in utilitarian, hand-woven, simple garb.
SarahBrown	testing	Mikis Theodorakis	The music is by the prolific contemporary music composer █████████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Euripides	In his adaptation of █████████' tragedy, Cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern, clear, and dramatic fashion.
SarahBrown	testing	Helen	And so in a real sense, █████ became the WMD of the Trojan War.
SarahBrown	testing	Agamemnon	Of course, for █████████, it's a game.
SarahBrown	testing	Abraham	In the case of Iphigenia, however, as in the Biblical tale of ███████ and Isaac, the father is asked to kill his own child, by his own hand.
SarahBrown	testing	Dukakis	███████ believes so, and (oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced) Aiello.
SarahBrown	testing	Cher	████'s observation about flowers leading to receiving one.
SarahBrown	testing	Cher	Earlier she was slightly snippy towards ████, who put her in her place quickly.
SarahBrown	testing	Cher	At the same time, the fact that ████ forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt's daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film - but just as quickly dropped.
SarahBrown	testing	Mitzi	It's all about █████.
SarahBrown	testing	Richard	The ███████ character was completely creepy.
SarahBrown	testing	Zack	I wish ████ hadn't have gotten killed.
SarahBrown	testing	Mitzi	I can't wait to see what █████ does next!
SarahBrown	testing	Goebbels	████████ motivation in backing down was not explored.
SarahBrown	testing	Reich	In the aftermath of Stalingrad the █████ had decided to go for 'total war'.
SarahBrown	testing	Goebbels	An SS massacre of women would have faced ████████ with a public relations disaster of massive proportion.
SarahBrown	testing	Meena Kumari	Then ████████████ died and it just brought the crowds rolling in.
SarahBrown	testing	Kamal Amrohi	This was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and ████████████ also had difficulty finding the money to make the film; looking at the sumptous sets and costumes, not surprising!!
SarahBrown	testing	Ghulam Mohammad	I only wish someone would find the ███████████████ songs that weren't included in the film, because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them.
SarahBrown	testing	Kamal Amrohi	████████████ made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon.
SarahBrown	testing	Pakeezah	So enjoy ████████ but don't miss out on any of the above...
SarahBrown	testing	Harris	For ██████ the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance.
SarahBrown	testing	Harris	There is just so much going on; in telling and re-telling this story ██████ is in the right place at the right time three times in a row, and he doesn't miss the opportunity to make something of it.
SarahBrown	testing	Michael McCord	██████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Clarksberg	The ██████████ government is all in favor of the Sheriff.
SarahBrown	testing	McCord	The Sheriff knows ██████ knows.
SarahBrown	testing	Dominic Monaghan	I loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer...the acting was top notch - honestly, I would watch ████████████████ read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great as well.
SarahBrown	testing	Tess	I'm looking forward to a feature-length work from ████ Nanavati!
SarahBrown	testing	Alyssa Milano	"The movie focuses around ""Fizzy"" (█████████████) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska."
SarahBrown	testing	Masako	Meanwhile, ██████ feels the changes in the behavior of her happier husband, and hires a private eye to investigate whether Shohei is having an affair.
SarahBrown	testing	Dança Comigo	"Title (Brazil): ""████████████?"""
SarahBrown	testing	Sanders	This, and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers, who hear the buzz of the dialog (always showing ███████' braininess in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys), without noting the obvious defects of the plot.
SarahBrown	testing	Barrie	Here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for ██████, which she was long aware of.
SarahBrown	testing	Barrie	██████ is after the proof that her father (who died in prison) was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang.
SarahBrown	testing	William Gargan -	She has several people assisting her - mugs like ████████████████ and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing burglaries that can't be pinned on her.
SarahBrown	testing	Sanders	Best has to remind him (when he feels better) to head for a location that ███████ told him to go to at a certain time.
SarahBrown	testing	Gilbert Emery	There is also an interesting role for █████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Bogart	Usually playing decent people (like the brow-beaten husband in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS) he plays a socially prominent weakling here - whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a ██████ movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Curt von Bardeleben	In this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called ███████████████████ who committed suicide in 1924.
SarahBrown	testing	Bobby Fischer	A major example of this is the chess legend █████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Luzhin	In the film, a World championship match is depicted, as between an Italian Grandmaster and ██████.
SarahBrown	testing	Tryfon	Best wishes ██████
SarahBrown	testing	Scott Wilson	She said that ████████████ portrayed a sociopath (no conscience) extraordinarily well.
SarahBrown	testing	Robert Blake	She also said that ████████████ portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly.
SarahBrown	testing	Susan Hayward's	Other than ███████████████ wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made.
SarahBrown	testing	Alfred Newman	The stirring █████████████ sound score, with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years.
SarahBrown	testing	Goliath	The scene with ███████ is a bit on the hokey side, but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made.
SarahBrown	testing	Esther	"This goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day, ""The Song of Ruth"" and ""██████ and the King."""
SarahBrown	testing	Raymond Massy	It is worth watching, and █████████████ is excellent as the prophet Nathan.
SarahBrown	testing	Freud	█████ might express such things in symbols.
SarahBrown	testing	Tristan	███████ ventures out of a rather twee English village called Wall.
SarahBrown	testing	Stormhold	█████████ is the world outside the wall.
SarahBrown	testing	Michelle Pfeiffer	(One of the witches is played by █████████████████, who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner.)
SarahBrown	testing	Ricky Gervais	█████████████ is an added extras.
SarahBrown	testing	Gervais	A buffoon trader throwing in standard ███████-type gags well.
SarahBrown	testing	Stardust	████████ is a full-on, large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars.
SarahBrown	testing	Harry Potter	Wholly positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of ████████████ romps.
SarahBrown	testing	Stardust	That is not to say that ████████ is without its faults.
SarahBrown	testing	Stardust	You are advised not to wait for ████████ on DVD.
SarahBrown	testing	Robert Taylor	I still vividly remember the film, especially the performance of █████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Taylor	I always thought ██████ was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks.
SarahBrown	testing	Lloyd Nolan's	The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying █████████████ character was.
SarahBrown	testing	Nolan	█████ was a great actor, but this character really aggravated me.
SarahBrown	testing	Paul Muni	About the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by █████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack Nicholson	The lead Martian's ██████████████ take-off is side-splitting.
SarahBrown	testing	Gundam	The story takes place during the same time line as the original ██████ in the year U.C. 0079 the time of the One year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate.
SarahBrown	testing	Shiro Amada	The Hero of the story is a young Lt. ███████████, who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.
SarahBrown	testing	Aina Sahalin	His life get complicated when he meets ████████████ a Jion ace pilot (the enemy), the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them.
SarahBrown	testing	Anavel Gato	Right up there with Char Aznable and ███████████ is Norris Packard, not the top villain in this series, but his presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight.
SarahBrown	testing	Antwone Fisher	Having developed a critical eye for film, and a love for good cinema, I went to see ██████████████ with my breath symbolically held.
SarahBrown	testing	Denzel Washington	While I am an unabashed fan of █████████████████ - both of his skill as an actor and of his public persona; I am an honest enough fan to admit the (very few) times when he hasn't quite hit the mark in a film or two.
SarahBrown	testing	John Waters	The whole thing has a ring of ███████████ and is boundlessly enthusiastic, but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements.
SarahBrown	testing	Billy Zane	██████████ moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a text-book lesson in how to use movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars.
SarahBrown	testing	Lugosi	How truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial; I rejoiced in seeing old ██████.
SarahBrown	testing	Chandu	██████ exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way.
SarahBrown	testing	Chandu	 Would you protect a girl as bravely as ██████ does?
SarahBrown	testing	Lugosi	██████ looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, mean drunk, and this only contributed to his performances.
SarahBrown	testing	Lugosi	I enjoy ██████' fancy performances.
SarahBrown	testing	Catherine Millar	13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by ████████████████ into a slightly above average shocker.
SarahBrown	testing	Morphett	But ████████ writes fine, intelligent dialogue.
SarahBrown	testing	Peter	"█████'s character evolves from a striving corporate employee with ""normal"" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful."
SarahBrown	testing	Julie	█████ goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Russel	███████████ did what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was.
SarahBrown	testing	Antwone Fisher'	Unlike that Dolphin tragedy, `███████████████ possesses an emotional joyous conclusion.
SarahBrown	testing	Derek Luke's	████████████ debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now.
SarahBrown	testing	Luke	I actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in ████'s acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances.
SarahBrown	testing	Luke	It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la ████
SarahBrown	testing	Denzel	Speaking of the great ██████, his work as the psychologist was masterful.
SarahBrown	testing	Fethard	The movie, by the admission of the inhabitants of ███████ who are old enough to remember the events, is fairly accurate (though they insist that the film-makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action).
SarahBrown	testing	Alan Jacobs	I find ███████████ review very accurate concerning the movie;however
SarahBrown	testing	James D'Arc	I had the opportunity to rent the DVD from blockbuster with a commentary from BYU's Curator, Motion Picture Archives ███████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Heber J. Grant	The then LDS Prophet ██████████████ approved of the movie understanding the deviations from historic content for dramatic expression and telescoping events.
SarahBrown	testing	Joseph Smith	For example the movie showed ████████████ on trial.
SarahBrown	testing	Joseph	Then ██████ was killed.
SarahBrown	testing	Joseph Smith	Historically ████████████ was never convicted of anything.
SarahBrown	testing	Phil Davis	Compelling acting from ██████████ and the rest of the cast.
SarahBrown	testing	Garth Merengie's	Downloading of ████████████████ Dark Place prompted Channel 4 to release a DVD of that series.
SarahBrown	testing	Emily Watson	This movie stars ████████████, of Breaking the Waves fame.
SarahBrown	testing	Emily Watson	A chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Emily Watson	████████████ is amazing in this, as well as the actor who plays the main character.
SarahBrown	testing	Antwone Fisher	██████████████ stands proudly alone in this regard: race is irrelevant, save for one fight that may, or may not, have been provoked by a racial slur.
SarahBrown	testing	Antwone Fisher's	████████████████ story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual.
SarahBrown	testing	Derek Luke	He is understatedly, and thoughtfully, portrayed by ██████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Denzel Washington	█████████████████, while obviously using his star power to have the film made, sticks to the background for the most part, and allows the film to be the Antwone Fisher story.
SarahBrown	testing	Lando Calrissian	They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of Endor while ████████████████ leads the attack on the Death Star.
SarahBrown	testing	John Williams	It's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic Acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by █████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Lando	Leia is still cool in this film as well as Han and █████.
SarahBrown	testing	John Williams's	███████████████ score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels.
SarahBrown	testing	Brennan	It's ███████'s death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the process.
SarahBrown	testing	John McIntire	█████████████ is the head villain of the piece and he was an under-appreciated actor with a vast range.
SarahBrown	testing	Menagerie	For a long time, 'The █████████' was my favorite 'Star Trek' episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by 'City on the Edge of Forever.'
SarahBrown	testing	Menagerie	What I used to prefer about '█████████' was that it's more hard-core Star Trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current Trek storyline.
SarahBrown	testing	Gene Roddenberry	I still think it's fairly ingenious the way ████████████████ incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode.
SarahBrown	testing	Kirk	Though the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for ████ and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of Spock being court-martialed is a clever one.
SarahBrown	testing	Pike	For instance, given the Talosians' mind-control abilities and Captain ████'s condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet?
SarahBrown	testing	Commodore Mendez	And there are other confusing questions about Pike and ████████████████... best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy ST's only two-parter.
SarahBrown	testing	Frank Sinatra	Seeing █████████████ when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs.
SarahBrown	testing	Frank Sinatra	This is not a great musical, but █████████████ was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940's.
SarahBrown	testing	Guerrero	Spike dashed into the ring and somersaulted over the top rope onto ████████ on the outside!
SarahBrown	testing	Guerrero	After recovering and taking care of Spike, ████████ slipped a table into the ring and helped the Wolverine set it up.
SarahBrown	testing	Bubba	The tandem then set up for a double superplex from the middle rope which would have put █████ through the table, but Spike knocked the table over right before his brother came crashing down!
SarahBrown	testing	Bubba	█████ caught fire and lifted both opponents into back body drops!
SarahBrown	testing	Benoit	Shortly after, ██████ latched Spike in the Crossface, but the match continued even after Spike tapped out.
SarahBrown	testing	Bubba	But because his opponents didn't force him through the table, █████ was allowed to stay in the match.
SarahBrown	testing	Benoit	██████ put Spike through a table moments later to even the score.
SarahBrown	testing	Kidman	Noble and ██████ locked up and tumbled over the ring, but raced back inside and grappled some more.
SarahBrown	testing	Noble	The fight spread outside the ring and █████ threw his girlfriend into the challenger.
SarahBrown	testing	Kidman	██████ tossed Nidia aside but was taken down with a modified arm bar.
SarahBrown	testing	Kidman	Noble continued to attack ██████'s injured arm back in the ring.
SarahBrown	testing	Kidman	██████'s injured harm hampered his offense, but he continued to battle hard.
SarahBrown	testing	Kidman	Noble tried to put ██████ away with a powerbomb but the challenger countered into a facebuster.
SarahBrown	testing	Kidman	██████ went for the Shooting Star Press again, but this time Noble just rolled out of harm's way.
SarahBrown	testing	Kidman	Noble flipped ██████ into a power bomb soon after and got the pin to retain his WWE Cruiserweight Championship!
SarahBrown	testing	Jeff	████ catapulted Regal over the top rope then took him down with a hurracanrana off the ring apron.
SarahBrown	testing	Jeff	Back in the ring, ████ hit the Whisper in the wind to knock Regal for a loop.
SarahBrown	testing	Jeff	████ managed to surprise Regal with a quick rollup though and got the pin to keep the European Championship!
SarahBrown	testing	Cena	Jericho tried to teach ████ a lesson as their match began by suplexing him to the mat.
SarahBrown	testing	Lionsault	Jericho launched into the █████████ but Cena dodged the move.
SarahBrown	testing	Cena	He goaded ████ to his feet so he could put on the Walls of Jericho.
SarahBrown	testing	Brock	█████ grabbed the title from the ref and draped it over his shoulder momentarily while glaring at RVD.
SarahBrown	testing	Brock	Van Dam 's quickness gave █████ fits early on.
SarahBrown	testing	Brock	█████ pulled himself together and began to take charge.
SarahBrown	testing	Brock	From there, █████ began to overpower RVD, throwing him with ease over the top rope.
SarahBrown	testing	Brock	The fight returned to the ring with █████ squeezing RVD around the ribs.
SarahBrown	testing	Brock	RVD broke away and soon after leveled █████ with a kick to the temple.
SarahBrown	testing	Brock	RVD followed with the Rolling Thunder but █████ managed to kick out after a two-count.
SarahBrown	testing	Heyman	He went for the pin, but ██████ pulled the ref from the ring!
SarahBrown	testing	Brock	After, RVD leapt onto █████ from the top rope and then threatened to hit the Van Terminator!
SarahBrown	testing	Booker	██████ tried to get back into the game by choking Show with a camera cable at ringside.
SarahBrown	testing	Booker	██████ smashed a TV monitor from the Spanish announcers' position into Show's skull, then delivered a scissors kick that put both men through the table!
SarahBrown	testing	Booker	██████ crawled back into the ring and Big Show staggered in moments later.
SarahBrown	testing	Booker	Show grabbed ██████'s throat but was met by a low blow and a kick to the face.
SarahBrown	testing	Booker	██████ climbed the top rope and nailed a somersaulting leg drop to get the pin!
SarahBrown	testing	Eric Bishoff	Before he could speak, ████████████ stopped The Game to apologize for getting involved in his personal business.
SarahBrown	testing	Bischoff	If Triple H signed with RAW, ████████ promised his personal life would never come into play again.
SarahBrown	testing	Bischoff	████████ said he's spent the past two years networking in Hollywood.
SarahBrown	testing	Stephanie McMahon	█████████████████ stepped out to issue her own pitch.
SarahBrown	testing	Bischoff	████████ cut her off and begged her to stop.
SarahBrown	testing	Bischoff	Triple H went to shake ████████'s hand, but pulled it away.
SarahBrown	testing	Shawn Michaels	Before he could go any further, though, ██████████████ came out to shake things up.
SarahBrown	testing	HBK	███ said the last thing he wanted to do was cause any trouble.
SarahBrown	testing	HBK	███ said there's nobody in the world that Triple H is better friends with.
SarahBrown	testing	HBK	He then turned and hugged ███, making official his switch to RAW!
SarahBrown	testing	Bischoff	████████ said the difference between the two of them is that he's got testicles and she doesn't.
SarahBrown	testing	Hollywood Hogan	Match 7: Tag Team Championship Match Christian and Lance Storm vs ███████████████ and Edge
SarahBrown	testing	Hogan	"The match started with loud ""USA"" chants and with █████ shoving Christian through the ropes and out of the ring."
SarahBrown	testing	Hogan	But Edge scored a kick to Christian's head and planted a facebuster on Storm to get the tag to █████.
SarahBrown	testing	Hogan	█████ began to Hulk up and soon caught Christian with a big boot and a leg drop!
SarahBrown	testing	Hogan	Storm broke up the count and Christian tossed █████ from the ring where Storm superkicked the icon.
SarahBrown	testing	Strom	He speared both of them into the corner turnbuckles, but missed a spear on █████ and hit the ref hard instead.
SarahBrown	testing	Hogan	Test raced down and took down █████ then leveled Edge with a boot.
SarahBrown	testing	Riksihi	███████ sprinted in to fend off Test, allowing Edge to recover and spear Storm.
SarahBrown	testing	Y2J	Christian distracted the ref, though, and ███ dashed in and clocked Edge with the Tag Team Championship!
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Angle	The Rock vs ██████████ and the Undertaker Three of WWE's most successful superstars lined up against each other in a Triple Threat Match with the Undisputed Championship hanging in the balance.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Angle	Taker and The Rock got face to face with ██████████ begging for some attention off to the side.
SarahBrown	testing	Taker	Soon after, █████ spilled out of the ring and The Rock brawled with Angle.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Angle	The Rock retaliated by latching on the ankle lock to ██████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Angle	The Rock picked himself up just in time to break up a pin attempt on ██████████.
SarahBrown	testing	the Last Ride	Taker picked Rock up and crashed him with █████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Taker	It looked like █████ was about to pass out, but The Rock broke Angle's hold only to find himself caught in the ankle lock.
SarahBrown	testing	Taker	Rocky hit the Rock Bottom, but █████ refused to go down and kicked out.
SarahBrown	testing	Brosnan	███████ is genius; as anyone will now testify, he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role.
SarahBrown	testing	Kinnear	███████ was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role.
SarahBrown	testing	Brosnan	███████ delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse.
SarahBrown	testing	Davis	I was also very impressed with Hope █████'s performance.
SarahBrown	testing	Rita Hayworth's	The glorious Technicolor shows off ███████████████ beauty and spectacular hair.
SarahBrown	testing	Lesley Brookes	One of the dancers, Maurine (██████████████) is determined to better herself and is going to audition for Vanity's Golden Wedding Cover Girl Competition.
SarahBrown	testing	Rusty	█████ just happens to find herself at the auditions as well.
SarahBrown	testing	Rusty	In a very funny scene Maurine has just had a so so audition and seeing █████, gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges!!!
SarahBrown	testing	Rusty	█████ does so with gusto!!!
SarahBrown	testing	Rita	The gowns that ████ wears are stunning.
SarahBrown	testing	Gene Kelly	"██████████ is also fantastic in the ""Alter Ego"" number where he dances with himself."
SarahBrown	testing	Hayworth	"""Poor John"" is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations - ████████ looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit."
SarahBrown	testing	Al Norman	"Look for █████████ in both ""Poor John"" and ""A Sure Thing""."
SarahBrown	testing	Rita	████ was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer.
SarahBrown	testing	Rusty	"After a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of America's top magazines, █████ bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy ""Cover Girl"" song."
SarahBrown	testing	Henry Brommell	In his first go as a Hollywood director, ██████████████ whips an enthralling yarn that is all of penetrating relatable marital issues with melancholic authenticity, and lacing such with an equally absorbing subplot of a father-son hit-man business.
SarahBrown	testing	Henry Brommell's	████████████████ brilliant 'Panic' is something of a rarity in Hollywood seldom seen (with the exception of 2002's 'Road to Perdition') since its conception in 2000it weaves two conflicting genres (organized-crime, family drama) into a fascinating, warm hunk of movie-viewing that is evenly strong in either
SarahBrown	testing	Barbara Stanwyk	The original with ███████████████ is saved only by Stanwyk's performance.
SarahBrown	testing	Bette Midler's	██████████████ version is much more interesting.
SarahBrown	testing	Jolene Blalock	██████████████ gave a commanding performance as Subcommander T'Pol.
SarahBrown	testing	Parn	CotHK does say it starts 5 years after the War of Heros which ████ was a part of.
SarahBrown	testing	Parn	Spark and his crew do, in some cases, resemble ████ and his crew once the journey kicks into gear, especially the love story that brews between Spark and Neese.
SarahBrown	testing	Wagnard	The only thing that makes me hurt is that Ashram and ███████ return.
SarahBrown	testing	Rhys-Meyers	███████████ coaches Nagra
SarahBrown	testing	Knightley	and encourages her to perform, while █████████ is supportive teammate and friend.
SarahBrown	testing	Kher	Here it's dad (well-played by ████) who can see both sides of the issue.
SarahBrown	testing	Michael Curtiz'	While the story is good on its own, I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is ███████████████ fantastically imaginative direction.
SarahBrown	testing	Williams	████████ was playing the role of a long-lost cousin.
SarahBrown	testing	Pernell Whitaker	Undoubtedly, once ████████████████ left the series, the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks.
SarahBrown	testing	Whitaker	████████ had often played the heavy in many episodes, and his absence left a void in the cast.
SarahBrown	testing	Ben	Since ███ was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, that did not leave too much room for any gunfights.
SarahBrown	testing	Dan Blocker	After ███████████ died, the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled.
SarahBrown	testing	Joe	The last season was pretty bad, as it featured Little ███ tracking down the killers of his wife, and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because Little Joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife, and how unfair it was that she was killed.
SarahBrown	testing	Marlene Gorris	██████████████ could perhaps have examined the psyche of Luzhin, rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others.
SarahBrown	testing	Gary olsen	██████████ was also very good and so were all the other cast members..
SarahBrown	testing	Gary Olsen's	I never quite new why it was can-celled till reading here today about ████████████ death at a relatively young age.
SarahBrown	testing	Dara Tomanovich	Wanted to see it just for ███████████████, but the plot and story were ok too.
SarahBrown	testing	Emerson Cod's	Even Detective █████████████ character has continued to grow in complexity.
SarahBrown	testing	Jiminy Crispies	███████████████!
SarahBrown	testing	Joseph Schildkraut	"██████████████████ as Vadas, is the only ""villian"" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here."
SarahBrown	testing	Margaret Sullivan	The two leads are equally accomplished, with █████████████████ doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman.
SarahBrown	testing	Jimmy Stewart	This movie belongs to █████████████ though.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	Mr. ███████ is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	Just watch ███████, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding.
SarahBrown	testing	James Stewart	In my estimation, █████████████ is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium.
SarahBrown	testing	Jimmy Stewarts	This is one of ██████████████ best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of ███████.
SarahBrown	testing	Greg Kinnair	████████████ is really good as the straight and narrow business man.
SarahBrown	testing	Pierce Brosnan	The story is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the humor is hilarious I never thought that ██████████████ would be this funny, but he really is and I must say this movie is a must see.
SarahBrown	testing	Oliver Stone's	"A surprising rent at a local video store, I was pleased to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge ██████████████ ""Natural Born Killers."""
SarahBrown	testing	Jean Pierre Leaud's	Watching ███████████████████ character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends.
SarahBrown	testing	yiannis zouganelis	Perhaps, one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films i've seen in the last ten years..Excellent performances(especially ██████████████████ is great), well-written script and effective direction from a very special, for the Greek very average standards, auteur.
SarahBrown	testing	Sam Peckinpah's	A film, obviously influenced by ███████████████ Straw Dogs, that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end.
SarahBrown	testing	Politiki Kouzina	It's a shame that in Greece didn't work commercially, in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like ████████████████..
SarahBrown	testing	John	████'s loss shocked the world.
SarahBrown	testing	Katey	█████ and the three kids are really a solid professional cast.
SarahBrown	testing	John	The hour lesson after ████'s death in real-life struck home to me.
SarahBrown	testing	John	ABC should be proud to maintain this show and even preserve this as ████'s final wish.
SarahBrown	testing	Howard W. Campbell Junior	Already as the Jewish watchman primary said, that he knows no one, who have a bad conscience about the war except from █████████████████████████, was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war.
SarahBrown	testing	Ingmar Bergman	And those who've seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting ██████████████ and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it.
SarahBrown	testing	Helen Hunt's	████████████ talent is magnificently shown in this movie!
SarahBrown	testing	saint jack	"One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else, this is the high point of Bogdanovich's fertile after- ""success"" career, when his best work was truly done (""██████████"", ""at long last..."", ""noises off""."
SarahBrown	testing	Afrika Bambaata	"It should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing (""This ain't New York, this is the Bronx!""), and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing, dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper ███████████████."
SarahBrown	testing	Brosnan	I love watching ███████ in any movie, he's always good, but this was totally different.
SarahBrown	testing	Boyer	She is, to put it simply, gorgeous, and █████ gives a most effective, understated performance, letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him.
SarahBrown	testing	Sharon Stone	████████████ is great, she always is, even if her movie is horrible(Catwoman), but this movie isn't, this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime, and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs.
SarahBrown	testing	Dickens	and possibly closest to the ███████ story line.
SarahBrown	testing	Dickens	His delivery of some of the lines from ███████ finally brought it to life for me.
SarahBrown	testing	Edward Woodward	███████████████ is everything we expect and more of the Ghost of Christmas present.
SarahBrown	testing	Deanna	 What I don't see is why everyone has such a problem with ██████'s choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene, from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice.
SarahBrown	testing	Bryan Fuller	Much like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can tell was created by ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Shakespeare	███████████ said that we are actors put into a great stage.
SarahBrown	testing	Katzir	██████'s film allows Israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live, and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes.
SarahBrown	testing	Dan	Thank you ███ for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world.
SarahBrown	testing	Bette	Stella, on the other hand, moves at a slower (and occasionally too slow) pace and though it's somewhat manipulative in its tears-inducing tale about a self-sacrificial mother, it works because █████ and the rest of the cast turn in great performances.
SarahBrown	testing	Artemisia	Even so █████████ could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked.
SarahBrown	testing	Sally Fields	Howz about a very VERY good ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Kevin Kline	There's a whole workshop going on with ███████████ on how to Overact very very subtly.
SarahBrown	testing	Robert Downey	So is █████████████, Jr. who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the Slick, Slimy Executive.
SarahBrown	testing	Cathy Moriarity	███████████████, while not the most gifted actress, is so charismatic and riveting, especially when she's angry.
SarahBrown	testing	Whoopi Goldberg	And even ███████████████ is decent, her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little Zing.
SarahBrown	testing	Whoopi	OK, no ██████ Bashing, I hear ya.
SarahBrown	testing	James Stewart	This first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement, romance, and █████████████ to the screen.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart-Mann	"""The Far Country"" is the only one out of all five ████████████ westerns that is often overlooked."
SarahBrown	testing	McIntire	What is ████████ there for?
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	███████, however, refuses the job, because he plans to get all the gold he can, and then pull out.
SarahBrown	testing	Flippen	So, ███████ is elected instead.
SarahBrown	testing	Madden	Flippen attempts to arrest ██████ and see that justice be done, but he cannot stand up to him, so he becomes the town drunk.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	The audience also realizes what ███████ must do.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	If ███████ stays and keeps on not doing anything about it, the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	███████ walks into his cabin.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	For a few seconds, his gun, in the gunbelt, is hanging on a post beside his bed, the gun is close up, ███████ is in the background, just inside the door.
SarahBrown	testing	Johnny	The script never condescends toward any character, not even the hapless ██████.
SarahBrown	testing	Moonstruck	I watch ██████████ at least once a year and I just viewed it again this Christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well.
SarahBrown	testing	Sergei Urusevsky	Fabulous cinematography from ████████████████ help to make this a stunning piece of work.
SarahBrown	testing	Rosenstrasse	████████████ is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions, which could have kept away many film goers looking for a Pianist similar plot.
SarahBrown	testing	Von Trotta	Fortunately, ██████████, a good screenwriter, opts for a feminist peep to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary Aryan German rather from a Jewish standpoint.
SarahBrown	testing	Rosenstrasse	████████████ is not a masterpiece, and some narrative flaws are well discerned.
SarahBrown	testing	Andy	The story, as the title says it, is about ████, a shy, silent guy, whom collects action figures, watches Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia.
SarahBrown	testing	Kal	███ is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre.
SarahBrown	testing	David	█████ is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, whom ran away with another guy.
SarahBrown	testing	Jay	And ███, a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts.
SarahBrown	testing	Tomlinson	The three leads/escapees are Genn, Steel and █████████: while the first two stick together, the latter goes his own way  only to run into the others on reaching safety.
SarahBrown	testing	Lee	Director ███ didn't have a lengthy career  with this and the somewhat similar (albeit with a change of both setting and viewpoint)
SarahBrown	testing	Weir	I think ████ pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style, but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of VHS this goes over the edge.
SarahBrown	testing	Neil Simon's	Also, be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate ████████████ brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter.
SarahBrown	testing	Walter Matthau	Here's my main point: ██████████████ is flat-out perfect, even beyond perfect, in this movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Richard Benjamin	About ████████████████: I personally find his acting annoying in general, and his work in this movie is no exception -- although he has some fine moments here.
SarahBrown	testing	Susan Minot	I will definitely obtain a copy of the ███████████ book and read it.
SarahBrown	testing	Tassi	I almost dig it when █████ got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises.
SarahBrown	testing	Stacy Edwards	"█████████████, of ""In the Company of Men"" fame, shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwards."
SarahBrown	testing	Ann Bronte's	"It's hard to gauge today just how forceful, feminist and extraordinary ████████████ masterpiece, ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"", actually was."
SarahBrown	testing	Helen Huntingdon	Emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily, mental, societal  her heroine, ████████████████, escapes a miserable marriage, flees brutality and alcoholism, braves not only her abusive husband's fury, but society's pinched intolerance and malicious gossip, to wreak change in her life.
SarahBrown	testing	Tara Fitzgerald	███████████████ inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine, and as has been said here by other reviewers, no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle.
SarahBrown	testing	Toby Stephens	█████████████, striking sparks off her, contributes just the right combination of headstrong, handsome youth and passionate, yearning vulnerability.
SarahBrown	testing	Rupert Graves	█████████████ (one of my favourite British actors ever) enjoys himself as the charismatic villain (so much so that you're almost with him at the end.
SarahBrown	testing	Ned Kelly	I'm sure that not many people outside of Australia have ever heard of the legend of █████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Ned Kelly's	The movie tells the story of ███████████ life.
SarahBrown	testing	Kelly	When █████ is fed up with the way everything goes, he forms a gang with his brother and two other men.
SarahBrown	testing	Robin Hood	I guess nobody really knows, because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth: one camp says he was a hero, some kind of ██████████, the others will say he was an ordinary criminal, a murderer and a thief.
SarahBrown	testing	Fanny	"As █████ says, ""We've been shaken out of the magnolias."""
SarahBrown	testing	Bush	It can't all be blamed on Mr. ████ - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elected him after his lies had been exposed.
SarahBrown	testing	Turturro	Suffice to say that ████████ is magnificent as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and Em matches him step for step as the strong-minded woman who is drawn to him.
SarahBrown	testing	Peter Weir	Although I've long been a fan of ██████████, I hadn't watched any of his Australian movies until I watched The Last Wave.
SarahBrown	testing	David	For █████'s peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence.
SarahBrown	testing	David	But █████ believes there's a mystery underneath the murder, linked to tribal rituals.
SarahBrown	testing	Weir	But there's also the way ████ suggests the supernatural in the movie.
SarahBrown	testing	David	█████ has dreams that warn him of the future.
SarahBrown	testing	David	But it's also related to the case █████ is defending.
SarahBrown	testing	Weir	Out of little events ████ manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression, suggesting future horrors without really showing anything.
SarahBrown	testing	Charles Wain's	██████████████ score is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo.
SarahBrown	testing	Stuart	"And yet, they proudly put their name on a show with ""██████"", ""I-speak-a-no-enlish Chinese lady"" and ""UPS guy on speed""."
SarahBrown	testing	Ron Leibman	And, I LOVE ███████████-he's foxy!!
SarahBrown	testing	Norma Rae	Of course, he's not nearly as foxy as he was in █████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Porky	If you liked movies such as █████'s, Fast Times, Last American Virgin, or any of the other 80s teen-focused movies, you'll love this one!!
SarahBrown	testing	Jack Torrance's	The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in ███████████████ mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground.
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, ███████'s purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown.
SarahBrown	testing	Stephen King	"Before I begin this, let me say that I have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the ""Authorized Version"" of this movie, remade by ████████████, himself, in 1997."
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	███████ really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film.
SarahBrown	testing	Magus	"In the direction of the movie AND the writing of the screenplay, itself, he acquired the title ""█████"" beyond question."
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	███████'s genius is like magic.
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	There was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, ███████ saw that from the beginning.
SarahBrown	testing	Wendy Torrence	(██████████████)
SarahBrown	testing	Wendy	"You could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with █████ and ""Doc."""
SarahBrown	testing	Olive Oyl	(So WHAT if she also played █████████?!
SarahBrown	testing	Olive Oyl?	██████████
SarahBrown	testing	Popeye	*lol* (██████ was also released in 1980.)
SarahBrown	testing	Danny	They were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed █████ how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.
SarahBrown	testing	Danny	The idea of █████'s older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.
SarahBrown	testing	Nicholson	When █████████ looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack	"████ quickly embarks on his trek from the ""jonesing"" alcoholic to a certifiable insane person."
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by ███████.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack	"████'s instant friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing NEED of the atmosphere to which Lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ...""hair of the dog that bit me."""
SarahBrown	testing	Jack Torrence	(█████████████)
SarahBrown	testing	Wendy	and █████ whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack	It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up ████ is.
SarahBrown	testing	Nicholson	█████████'s final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history.
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	███████'s ending was perfection.
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	Look what ███████ put IN.
SarahBrown	testing	Stephen King	"*Me being Me* ... Take this movie, and sitck it in your ████████████ collection, and take the 1997 ""Authorized"" version done by King and stick it down in the kiddie section."
SarahBrown	testing	Nicole Kidman	"The third entry in the ""Stepford"" franchise, but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down, whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with █████████████ are commonly known and very popular."
SarahBrown	testing	Stepford	"The main difference here, like the title implies, is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective ""████████ treatment"", licensed by the local Men's Association."
SarahBrown	testing	Harding	The ███████ family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford.
SarahBrown	testing	Martin Scorsese	Thank the Lord for ███████████████, and his love of the movies.
SarahBrown	testing	Jamie Foxx	I was actually rather surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, having never really been a ██████████ fan, and having the over-used plot that it has.
SarahBrown	testing	Hudson Hawk	The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, ███████████, 48 Hours, etc. etc. etc.)
SarahBrown	testing	Jamie Foxx	██████████ actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film.
SarahBrown	testing	Michael Cacoyanis	One sequence particularly stays in mind, and could only have been fashioned by a great director, as █████████████████ undoubtedly is.
SarahBrown	testing	Achilles	Meanwhile, the proud ████████ discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent, dishonorable way.
SarahBrown	testing	Gackt	The way █████ does his pouting faces or just the way they act, VERY ANIME.
SarahBrown	testing	Stardust	Highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, ████████ tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful.
SarahBrown	testing	Neil Gaiman	But the real power in the film is the novel by ███████████ and the script made from his creative and fertile mind.
SarahBrown	testing	Stardust	████████ creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.
SarahBrown	testing	James Cameron	Even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled, DA can make it big if worked on properly, and i think a name like █████████████ should take on this challenge.
SarahBrown	testing	Sean Connery	████████████ was very good in his role as always.
SarahBrown	testing	Kate Capshaw	████████████ was a nice touch as well, and looks fantastic.
SarahBrown	testing	Blair Underwood	███████████████ was a pleasant surprise, I didn't really expect anything great from him, but he pulled off a great performance.
SarahBrown	testing	Ed Harris	█████████ was the real gem in the film.
SarahBrown	testing	Scott Bartlett's	████████████████ 'OffOn' is nine minutes of pure craziness.
SarahBrown	testing	Bartlett	There's no story to speak of, but ████████ uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology.
SarahBrown	testing	Ben	I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans that were part of ███'s baseball family.
SarahBrown	testing	Ben	The scene where ███ is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious!
SarahBrown	testing	Anthony Mann	Much like other ████████████ pictures, The Far Country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery.
SarahBrown	testing	Mann	Both of which play out amongst some of ████'s peccadilloes like honour, integrity, betrayal and of course, death!
SarahBrown	testing	William H. Daniels	"The cinematography from ██████████████████ is superlative, tho not done any favours by current DVD prints, and the film has a few surprises and a ""will he wont he?"" core reeling the viewers in."
SarahBrown	testing	"Richard Grieco,(Rex),""Dead"	"This film caught me off guard when it started out in a Cafe located in Arizona and a ██████████████████████████ Easy"",'04, decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot, sexy waitress."
SarahBrown	testing	George Lopez	Love ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Robinson	████████'s pivotal death scene, in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called 'Home', depicts him immersed in images of the world's once-beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them, beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced Thorn's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted, among other horrors.
SarahBrown	testing	Vic Morrow	██████████ as the villain is superb.
SarahBrown	testing	Sheen	"When █████ ""tests the water"" in his '34 Ford (COOL) along the mountainous highway it is spectacular!"
SarahBrown	testing	Soylent Green	█████████████ IS...a really good movie, actually.
SarahBrown	testing	Heston	I don't really like ██████ in his sci-fi efforts.
SarahBrown	testing	Superman	He's one of those actors who, like ████████, manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time.
SarahBrown	testing	Soylent Green	And indeed, he sneers his way through much of █████████████, too, but as he's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully I don't really mind.
SarahBrown	testing	Soylent Green	█████████████ makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks just like 1973), and it's lacking in action.
SarahBrown	testing	Edward G. Robinson	But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt, and highly stratified society, and I was so pleased to see that ██████████████████ had such a moving, funny final role.
SarahBrown	testing	Heston	Nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with ██████ - really make the movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Soylent Green	The message of █████████████ is pretty relevant these days, when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to.
SarahBrown	testing	Ettore Scola -	A SPECIAL DAY (██████████████ Italy/Canada 1977).
SarahBrown	testing	Ettore Scola's	"It's surprising ██████████████ ""Una giornate particulare"" is relatively unheralded, even hated by some critics."
SarahBrown	testing	Leonard Maltin	Time Out calls it 'rubbish' and ██████████████, somewhat milder, 'pleasant but trifling.'
SarahBrown	testing	Hitler	The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archive footage from ██████'s visit to Italy on may 8th 1938.
SarahBrown	testing	Loren	Set against this background, we first meet Antonietta (█████), a lonely, love-ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building.
SarahBrown	testing	Scola	█████ playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings.
SarahBrown	testing	Bourne	I liked the first two ██████ movies, but I loved this one.
SarahBrown	testing	Ann	Or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because ███'s recall of distant events is rather faulty.
SarahBrown	testing	Ann	███'s behavior seems totally inexplicable.
SarahBrown	testing	Harris	Despite Ann's rejection of ██████, she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed.
SarahBrown	testing	Ann	The film showed a pattern for ███'s romantic relationships.
SarahBrown	testing	Harris	This pattern held with ██████ and two husbands.
SarahBrown	testing	Lila	In contrast, ████ married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died.
SarahBrown	testing	Lila	Perhaps ████ was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail.
SarahBrown	testing	Ann	I kept wondering about the house ███ was living in during her final days.
SarahBrown	testing	Ann	███ always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters.
SarahBrown	testing	Majin	The Yokai Monsters series is not the equal of █████ at its best, but the Yokai are nevertheless great fun.
SarahBrown	testing	Jim Carrey	pretty soon in became clear this is no comedy, or at least not a '██████████ type' one.
SarahBrown	testing	Simba	This one, being the third part to The Lion King (█████'s Pride is the second.)
SarahBrown	testing	Hakuna Matata	"After searching far and wide, they find the place of ""█████████████""."
SarahBrown	testing	Simba	They then meet a small lion named █████, and go through many things that parents today go through.
SarahBrown	testing	Takashi Miike's	███████████████ incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements.
SarahBrown	testing	Miike	█████ understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance.
SarahBrown	testing	Miike	I appreciated the fact that █████ was more honest than most American filmmakers.
SarahBrown	testing	Miike	But a self-possessed █████ is still stranger than most filmmakers.
SarahBrown	testing	Truman Capote's	"Based on ███████████████ best-selling book, and with B&W lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films, ""In Cold Blood"" presents a terrifying story, especially in that first Act, as the plot takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads."
SarahBrown	testing	Richard Brooks	Director ██████████████ used the actual locations where the real-life events occurred, even the farmhouse ... and its interior!
SarahBrown	testing	Sciamma	███████ works with specialized, slightly sanitized material that is as off-putting to some as it is alluring to others.
SarahBrown	testing	Anne	Being less special ████ is more truly accessible to the boys.
SarahBrown	testing	Marie	█████ has the more essential quality for a teenage girl: she suffers inwardly.
SarahBrown	testing	Flroiane	████████ doesn't so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt.
SarahBrown	testing	Marie	█████ is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as Floriane.
SarahBrown	testing	Marie	Floriane takes advantage of this to make █████ first her slave and a cover for her assignations, then, lacking any other friends, her confidante.
SarahBrown	testing	Floriane	All the other girls think ████████ a slut, an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases, because it leads them on.
SarahBrown	testing	Anne	████ is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that's earthier and more real than the other girls'.
SarahBrown	testing	Sciamma	But ███████ has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics.
SarahBrown	testing	Amitabh	But this movie is about ███████ and thats all you remember at then end.
SarahBrown	testing	Amitabh	███████ comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious.
SarahBrown	testing	meera nachi thi	Memorable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, ███████████████) and everything with his dadoo.
SarahBrown	testing	Amitabh	If you want 3 hours of entertainment with ███████ at his absolute best - this is it.
SarahBrown	testing	Fallon	Although ██████ is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role.
SarahBrown	testing	Ione Skye	At times, I felt supporting actress █████████ would have been a better actor for the role.
SarahBrown	testing	Brosnan	Clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by ███████ and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way.
SarahBrown	testing	Delirious	Please if you ever see one comedy in your life this is it, if only all movies could be █████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Jabba	Also, the disco was taken out of █████'s palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.
SarahBrown	testing	George Lopez	That is why I was disappointed to learn recently that ████████████ is a racist, and that he fired Masiela Lusha off the show, simply because he discovered that she wasn't a Latino emigrant, but was an emigrant from Albania.
SarahBrown	testing	George Lopez	That is why I was disappointed to learn recently that ████████████ is a racist, and that he fired Masiela Lusha off the show, simply because he discovered that she wasn't a Latino emigrant, but was an emigrant from Albania.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurtwood Smith	Everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to ██████████████ who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his Red Forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness.
SarahBrown	testing	Topher Grace	████████████ is of course the main reason why this show is so good.
SarahBrown	testing	Hyde	████'s character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time, although I will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons.
SarahBrown	testing	Eric	The only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with her and ████ because they were f...... hilarious together.
SarahBrown	testing	Dudley Moore	The late ████████████ had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood.
SarahBrown	testing	Moore	█████ lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years.
SarahBrown	testing	Steve Gordon	The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named ████████████, who, sadly, died the following the year.
SarahBrown	testing	Henry Bromell	Panic is a sneaky little gem of a film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great pleasure, that █████████████ is a much better writer/director than that.
SarahBrown	testing	Joan	There is nothing else quite like it on television right now either, unless you count ████ of Arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too.
SarahBrown	testing	Alex	"	From a concept that is intrinsically interesting, Bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive, and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what ████ is going through."
SarahBrown	testing	Alex	And it is at that point that ████ finds himself as the story unfolds; ergo, the midlife crisis, or more specifically, the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape.
SarahBrown	testing	Alex	In that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt, confusion and uncertainty, all of which have been successfully suppressed until now; all the things that have always been at the core of ████'s life, only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing, demanding confrontation and resolution.
SarahBrown	testing	Alex	It's a complex character created and delivered by Macy with an absolute precision that makes ████ truly memorable.
SarahBrown	testing	Michael	"	Sutherland is extremely effective, as well; his ███████ is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it's chilling."
SarahBrown	testing	James Bond	This is not some pulp fiction or ██████████ type villain, but a true personification of evil, hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door, which is what makes it all the more disconcerting.
SarahBrown	testing	Sutherland	And ██████████ brings it all to life brilliantly, with a great performance.
SarahBrown	testing	Meryl Streep	It is my opinion that she is BETTER than ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Liam Cunningham's	And, █████████████████ steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliant.
SarahBrown	testing	Alex	████ (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people for living.
SarahBrown	testing	Alex	Macy is excellent as the depressed ████.
SarahBrown	testing	Royal Dano	██████████ provides an amazing heartfelt performance as Old Man Wrenchmuller.
SarahBrown	testing	Lao	"I remember seeing him in ""The 7 Faces of Dr. ███"" as a bad guy who met a bad end."
SarahBrown	testing	Wile E. Coyote	The creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments, little subtle costume digs at other sci-fi movies, and even a scene ripped from the pages of ██████████████!
SarahBrown	testing	Greys Anatomy and Brothers	This show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites ██████████████████████████ and Sisters.
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	It's almost as if ███████ was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening.
SarahBrown	testing	gore	What makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares, not the blood and ████, not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack Torrence	It's the destruction of █████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Nicholson	Some people have complained about the casting of █████████ in this role, saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film, given his past roles and his appearance.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack	We know he's going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and ████'s appearance only furthers this notion.
SarahBrown	testing	Wendy	"The scene that always shocks me is when █████ interrupts him typing, and he utterly loses it, telling her to ""leave him the f*** alone""."
SarahBrown	testing	Jack	Many critics have noted that whenever ████ talks to a ghost, there's a mirror present, showing that he may as well be talking to himself.
SarahBrown	testing	Hallorann	His psychic powers are not in question  how else would █████████ know to come to the hotel?
SarahBrown	testing	Tony	It appears that his body is taken over by ████, but how do we know for sure?
SarahBrown	testing	Jack	Has ████ really been there before?
SarahBrown	testing	Jack Nicholson	When talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with ██████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	███████'s long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror.
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	███████ masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more.
SarahBrown	testing	John Ritter	Let me say first that this show was top tier when ███████████ was there.
SarahBrown	testing	Ritter	When ██████ was on the show, I would shriek in laughter (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that he's gone, I'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh.
SarahBrown	testing	Katey Sagal	███████████ is great as well, and she too is a likable character.
SarahBrown	testing	Kerry	The only fault of the show is that the show never really gives █████ anything to be happy about.
SarahBrown	testing	Bridget	She's always after ███████, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there.
SarahBrown	testing	Artemisia	The film of █████████ may be considered treason, or as true artistic license.
SarahBrown	testing	Artemisia	In both the movie and (it seems) in history, █████████ was a painter, before all else.
SarahBrown	testing	David Broadhurst	████████████████
SarahBrown	testing	Pacino	The budget is obviously low and not everybody is ██████ behind the lens but it doesn't matter because it never once takes itself seriously.
SarahBrown	testing	Rani Mukherjee	As for ██████████████ ( i think thats how you spell her last name)
SarahBrown	testing	Celie	This is the story of a young black woman named █████, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century.
SarahBrown	testing	Speilberg	█████████'s direction is all over this picture, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances.
SarahBrown	testing	Alice Walker	While it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the African story, both of which were so vivid in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, allowing the voice of ████████████ to shine through.
SarahBrown	testing	Robert Wagner	█████████████ played his role good.
SarahBrown	testing	Turner	The relationship between Saboto Jr. and ██████ was a nice one.
SarahBrown	testing	Ron Ramin	The music in the film is really good by █████████ and fits the flick very well.
SarahBrown	testing	Eugene Levy	One of John's Funniest, ███████████ is great in this one as well, Just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on DVD, i have it on video tape, but feel that this film deserves DVD (and extras would be great)
SarahBrown	testing	E. M. Forster	Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of █████████████ novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992.
SarahBrown	testing	Greene	No, people don't talk that way except in books, but ██████ was sending a message about an England that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world.
SarahBrown	testing	Mukerjee	While Mr. ████████ resembled more a Brahamin, at least his nationality was kept, and his final conversation with Paxinou is priceless.
SarahBrown	testing	Lars von Trier	██████████████ shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension.
SarahBrown	testing	Hitchcock	Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like █████████ and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene.
SarahBrown	testing	William Shakespeare	███████████████████ would be very proud of this particular version of his play.
SarahBrown	testing	Kenneth Branagh's	█████████████████ Hamlet is simply genius.
SarahBrown	testing	Shakespeare	Not only because it was written by ███████████, but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing, even if it went just over four hours.
SarahBrown	testing	Richard Briers	I doubt you'll find a better Polonius than ██████████████' delicious portrayal.
SarahBrown	testing	Kenneth Branagh	Of course, we must talk about ███████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Shakespeare	When you watch him on screen, it's almost as if he knew exactly how ███████████ wanted the role to be played.
SarahBrown	testing	Oscar	How he wasn't nominated for an █████ is a total mystery.
SarahBrown	testing	Shakespeare	If you love this play and are a fan of ███████████, you definitely need to check this movie out.
SarahBrown	testing	Shakespeare	Even if you don't really care for ███████████, the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film.
SarahBrown	testing	Schindler	"I can't believe I am just now seeing this film -- I think perhaps I thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated, and I avoided Roots for the same reason -- just as I have yet to see █████████'s List -- I don't want to be ""entertained"" by other peoples' pain, not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be."
SarahBrown	testing	Oprah	I couldn't believe the character █████ played at the age of 35!
SarahBrown	testing	Whoopi	And I adore ██████ to start with - she was amazing.
SarahBrown	testing	Moonstruck	"These characteristics of idealistic imagery which ""██████████"" possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood."
SarahBrown	testing	Moonstruck	"""██████████"" is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City."
SarahBrown	testing	Moonstruck	"The kindred spirits with everyone in ""██████████"" seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties."
SarahBrown	testing	Cher	One might wonder about ████ playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Moonstruck	"In ""██████████"", however, I think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation."
SarahBrown	testing	Moonstruck	"All of the characters in ""██████████"" are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity."
SarahBrown	testing	Cher	This is ████'s best performance ever as an actress!!
SarahBrown	testing	Norman Jewison	"Director, ██████████████ (Famous for ""Cincinnati Kid"", ""Thomas Crowne Affair"", and most famous for ""In The Heat Of The Night"" which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film!"
SarahBrown	testing	Cher	████ is not Italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director!
SarahBrown	testing	Moonstruck	"This movie ""██████████"" is totally happy go lucky!!"
SarahBrown	testing	Johan	█████
SarahBrown	testing	Gene Kelly	 It's always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age, and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify (there is plenty of learning how to dance, but no singing) but I really think that ██████████ and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in Japan, looking for something... he knows not precisely what.
SarahBrown	testing	Adam Sandler	If ████████████ type stuff is up your alley, this probably won't be your cup of tea.
SarahBrown	testing	Ed O'Neill's	But I still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off, I'm going to loose it (████████████ face is PRICELESS!).
SarahBrown	testing	Randy	" you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with ""I'm a cool guy"" kind of guy (█████)."
SarahBrown	testing	Hyde	████ tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too.
SarahBrown	testing	Eddie Murphy	It should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Murphy	"██████ goes on for almost 70 minutes about dicks, pussy, tits and insaults so many famous people including his own ""family""."
SarahBrown	testing	Mr T.	At the time I saw the show I couldn't remember who █████ was but still laughed.
SarahBrown	testing	Eddie	Because that's what █████ do - he can make those impressions so good that it don't matter who the hell he's trying to do, it's still hilarious.
SarahBrown	testing	Murphy	And on top of that, we learn that ██████ actually is a very good singer.
SarahBrown	testing	Simon Geist	"███████████ is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called ""The Next Big Thing""."
SarahBrown	testing	Darla	His live-in female friend, █████, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as her and her father.
SarahBrown	testing	Darla	█████ is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character, depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior.
SarahBrown	testing	Magda	█████ is a prostitute, the character i liked the best.
SarahBrown	testing	Brent	█████ is a flat character with not much to him, as is Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands.
SarahBrown	testing	Mark	████ my words!
SarahBrown	testing	Douglas MacArthur	MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great manGeneral █████████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Thayer	"Though there is a continuity issue (there may be others) e.g. MacArthur's speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the U.S. Military Academy on accepting the ██████ award did not contain the phrase ""old soldiers never die; they just fade away."""
SarahBrown	testing	Truman	(That was in his speech to Congress upon his dismissal by President ██████) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two did not see eye to eye!)
SarahBrown	testing	Gregory Peck	████████████ is im-Peck-able as the general who vowed he would return to the Philippines in World War II.
SarahBrown	testing	Peck	Nevertheless, ████'s portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed.
SarahBrown	testing	Dan Blocker	"My most vivid memory of the show's original run,came shortly after the death of our beloved ""Hoss"" Cartwright,███████████."
SarahBrown	testing	Robert Bloch	Four stories written by ████████████ about various people who live in a beautiful, old mansion and what happens to them.
SarahBrown	testing	Denholm Elliott	The first has ███████████████ as a novelist who sees the killer he's writing about come to life.
SarahBrown	testing	Peter Cushing	The second has █████████████ becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife.
SarahBrown	testing	Pitt	Also the fourth one is actually very funny and ████ makes a VERY sexy vampire!
SarahBrown	testing	Pfeiffer	████████ is the reason to see this movie, and most of it comes off as believable.
SarahBrown	testing	Kevin Bacon	The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with ███████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Stanley Kubrick's	But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by █████████████████ The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack Nicholson	The movie follows a writer (██████████████) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack	But ████ is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack	After months of solitude and silence however, ████ becomes a grumpy and later violent.
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that ███████ makes.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack	It is also eerily calm when ████'s son is riding his bike through the barren hallways.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack Nicholson's	████████████████ performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	It's easy to classify characters in this movie (i.e.: ███████ is the selfish mutt, Itchy is cynical but believes Charlie, Carface is obviously the relentless villain, etc.).
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	You could tell ███████ was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	"The way ███████ reacted to it, ""no surprises whatsoever"", made it actually seem very boring."
SarahBrown	testing	Whippet	███████ Angel:
SarahBrown	testing	Odysseus	Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, e.g. the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes ████████ in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece,not some Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B-flick.
SarahBrown	testing	Duccio Tessari	Director ██████████████ relates the absorbing story at a constant snappy pace, maintains a properly serious and no-nonsense tone throughout, stages the stirring shoot-outs and exciting car chases with considerable rip-snorting brio, and punctuates the narrative with jolting outbursts of explosive bloody violence.
SarahBrown	testing	Silvano Ippoliti's	██████████████████ glossy cinematography boasts several graceful pans.
SarahBrown	testing	Gianni Ferrio's	███████████████ funky score hits the get-down groovy spot.
SarahBrown	testing	Indianvalues	The apt depiction of ████████████ and culture makes the viewer search for his/her roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on life.
SarahBrown	testing	Tatiana	███████ is beautiful and innocent.
SarahBrown	testing	Boris	Her fiancé █████ is sweet and patriotic.
SarahBrown	testing	Boris	You couldn't help but feel █████' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war.
SarahBrown	testing	Tatiana	He unwittingly breaks the news to ███████.
SarahBrown	testing	Boris	The musician actually never saw █████ buried, after all.
SarahBrown	testing	Boris	█████' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would have to be.
SarahBrown	testing	Kate	"I have seen her in ""Kiss Me, ████"" and ""Victor/Victoria,"" as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations."
SarahBrown	testing	Lucy	"My response to that is, ""So what?"" I wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of ████."
SarahBrown	testing	Rachel	And ██████ certainly gave us that, in great depth.
SarahBrown	testing	Lucy	"I also didn't want to see someone simply ""doing"" classic ████ routines."
SarahBrown	testing	Rachel	I also thought ██████ was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes.
SarahBrown	testing	Lucy	After all, those of us who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what ████ was really like in her early movie years.
SarahBrown	testing	Rachel	I think ██████ showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant.
SarahBrown	testing	Lucy	████ didn't fit the mold of the old studio system.
SarahBrown	testing	Rachel	I believe that ██████ deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon.
SarahBrown	testing	Lucy	"""████"" was a star turn for Rachel York."
SarahBrown	testing	Emmy	I also hope it brings her an ████.
SarahBrown	testing	Dudley Moore	████████████ makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch!
SarahBrown	testing	Gene Kelly	It confirmed ██████████'s amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer.
SarahBrown	testing	Kelly	Her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with █████.
SarahBrown	testing	Rita	I think that ████ was highly underrated as an actress- she plays every scene superbly here.
SarahBrown	testing	Gene	████ choreographed the dance sequences (he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here), and his 'Alter Ego' dance number is amazing.
SarahBrown	testing	Phil Silvers	One can say that a little bit of ████████████ goes a long way.
SarahBrown	testing	Gene	However, I was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with ████ and Rita.
SarahBrown	testing	Tom	'Poor ███' is a huge downer.
SarahBrown	testing	Kamal Amrohi	It seems as if destiny conspired to test ████████████ (the director) while at the same time secretly desiring to see him complete his masterpiece.
SarahBrown	testing	Pakeezah	████████ rides on metaphors, poetry and visual elocution.
SarahBrown	testing	Kamal Amrohi	████████████ is one of the rare poets of cinema and he left us all a gift.
SarahBrown	testing	Orson Welles	Normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Christina Ricci	The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by ███████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Oscar	So it's not gonna win an █████ but if you've got beer and friends round then you can't go wrong.
SarahBrown	testing	Miss Lemon	A series of random, seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister's boarding house has ██████████ quite agitated.
SarahBrown	testing	Poirot	But what ██████ sees is something far more sinister than Miss Lemon could have imagined.
SarahBrown	testing	Poirot	And ██████'s fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered.
SarahBrown	testing	Poirot	It's up to ██████ to bring a killer to justice.
SarahBrown	testing	Agatha Christie's	I appreciate how faithful the script is to █████████████████ original story.
SarahBrown	testing	Poirot	The major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts, the boarding house, the students, the ripped rucksack, and, of course, ██████'s ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens.
SarahBrown	testing	Nicoletis	Take the murder of Mrs. █████████ as an example.
SarahBrown	testing	Hickory Dickory Dock	In fact, the entire plot of ████████████████████ could have been used in a Giallo.
SarahBrown	testing	Kenneth Branagh	What an ambitious project ███████████████ undertook here and how well it was realized!
SarahBrown	testing	Shakespeare	"This is the first filmed version of 'Hamlet' to use the full text of ███████████'s play, but Branagh didn't do it just because ""it was there."""
SarahBrown	testing	Henry V.'	Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor/writer/directors, if not always the best, since he made his big splash with '█████████ One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times.
SarahBrown	testing	Oscar	This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an █████ nomination.
SarahBrown	testing	Ophelia	Her portrayal of ███████ is awesome in its depth of feeling, made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time!
SarahBrown	testing	Billy Crystal	Even █████████████ as a gravedigger works.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack Lemmon	The one cast member who doesn't, inexplicably, is ███████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Lemmon	In the very opening scene he appears, and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood, ██████ sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor.
SarahBrown	testing	Patrick Doyle's	Did I forget anything, other than ███████████████ score?
SarahBrown	testing	Kenneth Branagh	I'll just sum up by saying that ███████████████ may have made the definitive film version of 'Hamlet,' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one.
SarahBrown	testing	Greg Lombardo's	"Having seen and loved ███████████████ most recent film ""Knots"" (he co-wrote and directed that feature as well), I decided to check out his earlier work, and this movie was well worth the effort and rental."
SarahBrown	testing	Macbeth	The movie is well-paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of ███████.
SarahBrown	testing	Macbeth	I highly recommend checking out ███████ in Manhattan.
SarahBrown	testing	Ben	But before i say more when ███ obi-wan dies in the Imperial Ship Or Death
SarahBrown	testing	Yoda Dies	And █████████ From Either Old Age Or Internal Illness
SarahBrown	testing	Mace Windu	I reckon That made the movie ending a little bit interesting But the Producers or anyone should off made a spirit off Padme And ██████████ And Other Jedis that got killed with Younglings Under There Arms in the back ground
SarahBrown	testing	Bourne	If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching ██████ take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy.
SarahBrown	testing	Bourne	██████'s adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times.
SarahBrown	testing	Bourne	The agency tracking ██████ takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.
SarahBrown	testing	Damon	█████ is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) Story is like many others
SarahBrown	testing	John Cusack	There is little else to talk about in this film; even ███████████ has done better roles than this one.
SarahBrown	testing	Tracey Ullman	I highly applaud the casting of █████████████ as the neglected wife.
SarahBrown	testing	J. J. Anderson	██████████████ playing the very young Halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines.
SarahBrown	testing	Sean Connery	Maybe ████████████ was miscast in his role.
SarahBrown	testing	Sean Connerey	However █████████████ is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does.
SarahBrown	testing	Ed Harris	Especially █████████ is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer.
SarahBrown	testing	Arne Glimcher	█████████████ directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times.
SarahBrown	testing	Bill Ivans	(The real life pilot was ██████████, I don't know who played him in the series)
SarahBrown	testing	Sang-hyeon	"We see the conflicts of both of the characters- ██████████ being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and ""idiot"" brother, the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama."
SarahBrown	testing	Sang	There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (████, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.
SarahBrown	testing	Oldboy	Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor, much like ██████, only here with a bite (pun intended) meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being.
SarahBrown	testing	Bunuelian	What makes Thirst last in the mind is how elements come together, of drama and existential pains, of a █████████-surreal sense of Catholicism (I especially loved the dynamic between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood-sucking but really wants to be a vampire too), and of the erotic: the scenes where the priest finally gives in to Tae-Joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets.
SarahBrown	testing	Oldboy	If it's not as great as ██████, it's not something to carp about.
SarahBrown	testing	Thrist	But ██████ is an excellent addition to his oeuvre, and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general.
SarahBrown	testing	Van Dine	The Philo Vance murders by S.S. Van Dine were most popular at the time and the clever Mr. ████████ figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder.
SarahBrown	testing	Philo Vances	This is why you see so many ████████████ and so many studios putting them out.
SarahBrown	testing	Powell	 It turns out that ██████ had entered his little terrier Captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim.
SarahBrown	testing	Powell	██████ has a lovely group of suspects, as extensive as what normally is in a Thin Man mystery.
SarahBrown	testing	Powell Philo Vance	As this is the only ██████████████████ that is out on VHS or DVD by all means see this one or acquire it if you can.
SarahBrown	testing	Monty Python	It isn't an answer to anything, it's in itself something new, something funny and sometimes it's downright stupid and silly - but was ████████████ any different than silly?
SarahBrown	testing	Rackaroll	Also very funny is the scene when █████████, the sword-fighting knight, decides to show off with his sword - and subsequently smashes it into a wall, breaking it.
SarahBrown	testing	Gollum	"I didn't approve of the idea of the Ring being used by Schleimli, the ""██████"" character, in order to ""seduce"" the ladies."
SarahBrown	testing	Sauraus	The idea of Lord ███████ wanting to cover the lands with fondue wasn't that brilliant either.
SarahBrown	testing	Picasso	It is said, that even ███████ was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years!
SarahBrown	testing	Jerome Davenport	His problems lead him to ████████████████, a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his troubles stem from his childhood upbringing.
SarahBrown	testing	Antwone	 Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged ███████ to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that abandoned him.
SarahBrown	testing	Derek Luke	Actor, ██████████ demonstrated why he was so right for the part of Antwone Fisher.
SarahBrown	testing	Fisher	Although we only see her for a few minutes, the actress who played ██████'s mother gave an outstanding performance.
SarahBrown	testing	Kidman	The crowd really didn't care about either wrestler and didn't get interested until ██████ did a shooting star press.
SarahBrown	testing	William Regal	WWE European Championship: Jeff hardy v. █████████████ 5/10 I've never really liked regal as a wrestler, he lacks intensity and style.
SarahBrown	testing	Hardy	█████ was impressive but really didn't get a chance to show off his high flying act, although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match.
SarahBrown	testing	Cena Wins	█████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Brock Lesnar	WWE Intercontenital championship: RVD v. ████████████ 8/10
SarahBrown	testing	Brocks	Both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen, with ██████ pure power and raw energy vs. RVDs skill full moves and quickness.
SarahBrown	testing	Brock	The ending worked perfectly because it still preserved █████'s undefeated streak while giving RVD his just desserts in his home state.
SarahBrown	testing	Booker T v.	No disqualification match: ███████████ Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the RVD match but still a good follow up.
SarahBrown	testing	Booker T	Although it started off kinda slow (which it always is with big show) ████████ was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table.
SarahBrown	testing	Booker T. 7	The finisher was awesome, the ending was a great upset and big move up for ███████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Hogan	█████ comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Angle	Rock v. Undertaker v. ██████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Barky	█████
SarahBrown	testing	Peter Weir's	████████████ first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.
SarahBrown	testing	Richard Chamberlain	███████████████████ gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries.
SarahBrown	testing	Trudi	█████'s character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four.
SarahBrown	testing	Jessica	███████ is the party girl very single minded and knows what she wants and how to get it.
SarahBrown	testing	Siobhan	She is a likable character and is closest to ███████ the newly wed who whilst loving her husband completely can't help her eyes wandering to her work colleague.
SarahBrown	testing	Lucile Watson	I don't see why █████████████ was nominated for best supporting actor, i just don't think she did a very good job.
SarahBrown	testing	Davis	They are going by train to █████'s relatives house.
SarahBrown	testing	Eddie Murphy	I have never seen a man be more funny than ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Delirious	If you have seen Raw (1987) you will have to see █████████.
SarahBrown	testing	mary	am i the only one who saw the connection between the discussion of camus 'the myth of sisyphus' and ████'s life?
SarahBrown	testing	Denise Richards	The girls in it were really cute also, especially ███████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Jessica Alba	████████████ and 3.
SarahBrown	testing	James Cameron	█████████████!
SarahBrown	testing	Fox	"I Hate ███ and I'm sure a lot of you ""Dark Angel"" fans hate them too."
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Russell	████████████ did a incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined.
SarahBrown	testing	Rambo	Seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be █████ in space, and would have been happy if it was.
SarahBrown	testing	Arnie	He changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack █████ one liners, he does'nt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy ending.
SarahBrown	testing	Ekin Cheng	The storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in (I guess ██████████ pulls the girls
SarahBrown	testing	Tatyana Samojlova	The girl (a remarkable performance from █████████████████) is also loved by the young man's cousin and, when she doesn't receive word from her boyfriend, gives in to the latter and marries him.
SarahBrown	testing	CUBA	" The only other film I've watched from this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969; albeit via the much-shorter U.S.-release version!), a star-studded international production based on true events; given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING, I regret missing out now on his famous documentary I AM ████ (1964) a number of times when I was in Hollywood late last year: apart from receiving a one-week theatrical run, it was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a feature-length ""Making Of""!!"
SarahBrown	testing	Tiffany Shepis	██████████████ is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful.
SarahBrown	testing	Richard Elfman	Also ██████████████ does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend.
SarahBrown	testing	Chaplin	I don't remember if he spoiled more than those I've listed (I think the ███████ movies too), but as I wrote it'd be best if you watch them all beforehand!
SarahBrown	testing	Meg Ryan	It's a ████████ movie, but it's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways.
SarahBrown	testing	Zizek	█████ views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to, if you're open minded to see things through another perspective (even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you ...
SarahBrown	testing	Eddie Murpy	If you like ███████████ this is a must have to add to your collection.
SarahBrown	testing	Eddie	█████ was young and funny with his 80's haircut.
SarahBrown	testing	Eddie	"Other must have from █████ is ""Coming to America"" and ""48 hours""."
SarahBrown	testing	Victor Wong	"Another actor ""███████████"" has a small part in this movie."
SarahBrown	testing	Digby	He first did so with his dog, █████.
SarahBrown	testing	Ned	He learned this when he brought his mother back to life, and his childhood crush's father died in ███'s mother's place.
SarahBrown	testing	Ned	His father took him to boarding school, and when he left, ███ never saw his father again.
SarahBrown	testing	Ned	"Almost 20 years later, ███ owns a pie bakery, cleverly titled ""The Pie Hole."""
SarahBrown	testing	Ned	███ touches the victim, asks who killed them, and when the minute is up, he touches them again, and they solve it.
SarahBrown	testing	Peter Cushing	"Around the time that this came out, she also starred in ""Countess Dracula"" and ""The Vampire Lovers"" (also with █████████████)."
SarahBrown	testing	Barbara Steele	Maybe she - like ██████████████ - will remain known only as a scream queen, but mark my words: SHE IS A HOT SCREAM QUEEN!
SarahBrown	testing	Denholm Elliott	I guess that the only weird scene (so to speak) is where ███████████████ is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket.
SarahBrown	testing	Denholm	"What kind of a name is ""███████"" anyway?"
SarahBrown	testing	Roy	Well, ███ happened to have the coat, so he laid it out on his desk and placed the swatch right where it had been torn from.
SarahBrown	testing	Roy	Not 10 seconds later in the scene, we see the coat again, still lying on ███'s desk.
SarahBrown	testing	Gundam	"The first ""side-story"" in the universal century ██████ universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies."
SarahBrown	testing	Alfred	██████ is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool.
SarahBrown	testing	Gundam	"Each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an OVA and are sure to satisfy the craving for some ""mandatory"" mobile suit battles in a ██████ series."
SarahBrown	testing	Alfred	Not only do the characters, whom all except ██████ are caucasian, sound more believable in English but the performances of the English voice cast are on par and even surpass the Japanese one, instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action TV dramas.
SarahBrown	testing	Brosnan	In this movie, ███████ plays against type - and has lots of fun doing so (as does the audience).
SarahBrown	testing	Kinnear	"This is a fun movie, with very good scenes (a riveting, on-the-edge Brosnan and a good, compliant ""off""-the-edge ███████ have some good lines)."
SarahBrown	testing	Davis	"My only cavil is that Hope █████, playing the oh-so-tolerant wife (""Can I see your gun?"") doesn't appear more often: she could have been a marvellous foil to these men."
SarahBrown	testing	Sammo Hung	"██████████ already acted in the main role in 1983's ""Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain""."
SarahBrown	testing	Jodie Foster	This is one of the best ████████████ movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public's misconception of it as a teen flick.
SarahBrown	testing	Jodie	The three girls that play █████'s friends are somewhat amateurish but I do think it is worth seeing.
SarahBrown	testing	Maria Flom	Finally: thank you ██████████!
SarahBrown	testing	Logan Bartholomew	"My favorite line in this movie is when █████████████████ says: ""rosy cheeks"", when he is talking about his baby daughter."
SarahBrown	testing	Erin Cottrell	He is such a great actor, as well as █████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Catscratch	The only ██████████ merchandise available on Nick Shop is a great lookin shirt, but very very very expensive!!!
SarahBrown	testing	Hans Zimmer's	I loved, as always, █████████████ score.
SarahBrown	testing	Bernard Rose	And what a directorial debut by ████████████!
SarahBrown	testing	Anthony Mann	Good Technicolor adventure from Universal-International, directed by ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Duvall	After seeing this film, you may think ██████'s appearance is reincarnation at it's best.
SarahBrown	testing	Peter Rodgers Melnick	I wish the composer, █████████████████████ had a CD or there was a soundtrack available.
SarahBrown	testing	Hyde	With the constant changing of relationships and finding out who ████'s real dad is, this show was a hit when it started in August of 98, though it was set in 1976.
SarahBrown	testing	kajol	The chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and █████.
SarahBrown	testing	Shahid-Amrita	But its a █████████████ film.
SarahBrown	testing	Sooraj Barjatya	hats off to Mr. ███████████████...
SarahBrown	testing	Kubrick	███████ again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film.
SarahBrown	testing	Jack Nicholson	Of course it doesn't hurt that ██████████████ gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.
SarahBrown	testing	Scatman Crothers	Plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (████████████████).
SarahBrown	testing	Meena Kumari	From the finely crafted sets, to those haunting looks ████████████ gives, no one can ever forget it.
SarahBrown	testing	Sahibjaan	You get the feeling of how trapped █████████ is in among all the amazing jewelery she wears and fountained court yard she casually walks past.
SarahBrown	testing	Christy	Cree Summer is excellent as ███████.
SarahBrown	testing	Tsui Hark's	I remember well ███████████ original Zu Warriors made 18 years earlier.
SarahBrown	testing	Cecilia Cheung	██████████████ appears to at least have matured in her acting, but it is still quite raw.
SarahBrown	testing	Kelly Lin	█████████ was the new revelation for me.
SarahBrown	testing	Tsui Hark	Given that both movies are made by the legendary █████████, the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in Hong Kong has changed over two decades.
SarahBrown	testing	Anne Marie	The only bad cast member was the actress who played ██████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Anne Marie Fahey	I say this because he found someone who didn't look a single bit like ████████████████ herself.
SarahBrown	testing	Hadley Kay	Also ██████████ was the perfect choice for the voice of Dark Heart (I always thought so
SarahBrown	testing	Darling Lili	████████████ is a mixture of Perfection and Magic!
SarahBrown	testing	Blake Edwards	The brilliance of the Director; █████████████ is shown to be at his best.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	██████████ was a perfect return to the full-length feature animation film (as opposed to the compilation films of the 40's), and expensive depth via the multi-plane camera returns to the film in no other way.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	Also, appreciated the continuity--██████████ always loses her shoe throughout the film.
SarahBrown	testing	Moonstruck	"The ""movie aimed at adults"" is a rare thing these days, but ██████████ does it well, and is still a better than average movie, which is aging very well."
SarahBrown	testing	Cher	Cage and ████ do very nice work.
SarahBrown	testing	Yorick	For one, the graveyard scene when Hamlet encounters ██████ (everyone knows about THAT scene by just going to elementary school), and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done.
SarahBrown	testing	Shakespeare	The logic used in this scene was tremendous--I suppose a testament to ███████████ more than anything else.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Russels	I think that this film was one of ████████████ good movies.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt russel	███████████ is my favorite actor so I think that he is a good actor in any role he plays.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Russel	If you see this movie and like it I think that you should see Back Draft also with ███████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Garbo	As for █████ herself, like her other very early American films she, too, looks different.
SarahBrown	testing	Garbo	The film is about █████ and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord.
SarahBrown	testing	Garbo	Years pass and by now █████ has become a new singing sensation who is world-famous.
SarahBrown	testing	Doña Bernarda	When she returns to her hometown years later, her old boyfriend (who HAD promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother, █████████████, refused to allow it) sees her.
SarahBrown	testing	Garbo	And, more importantly, will █████ even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly?
SarahBrown	testing	Garbo	In a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream, he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where █████ is now staying.
SarahBrown	testing	Garbo	Soon, Cortez is seen wandering back to █████'s home--he's love-sick and needs her.
SarahBrown	testing	Garbo	In this scene, █████ is quite luminous and can't tell him to leave--as they dissolve in each other's arms.
SarahBrown	testing	Doña Bernarda	When █████████████ learns of this, she is not pleased.
SarahBrown	testing	a Pork Queen	Evidently, ████████████ is a better catch than an internationally known singer.
SarahBrown	testing	Garbo	Because of the meddling of this nasty old lady, █████ leaves--unwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son.
SarahBrown	testing	Cortez	But, ██████ comes running--announcing he MUST have her and won't rest until he has her as his wife.
SarahBrown	testing	Cortez	Moments after making this proclamation, a family friend talks to ██████ and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation.
SarahBrown	testing	Cortez	Despite ██████ being a wimp through and through, for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him.
SarahBrown	testing	the Pork Queen	And so, he marries ██████████████ and lives a very dull life.
SarahBrown	testing	Cortez	So, in light of this, it's surprising they gave ██████ such an unlikable character to play.
SarahBrown	testing	Valentino	Instead of the usual confident █████████-like role they'd been giving him, here he is an indecisive wimp--a HUGE wimp.
SarahBrown	testing	Garbo	As for █████, the role helped establish her as a big star--as she was THE focus of the film and played a character much like her later personas.
SarahBrown	testing	Beckham	"It came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from ""Bend it like ███████"", where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister."
SarahBrown	testing	Kung Fu	Here we have it transferred to a Turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding by doing ███████.
SarahBrown	testing	Semra Turan	The lead actress ███████████ is not only Denmark's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance, so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress.
SarahBrown	testing	- Xian Gao	██████████, a Chinese cinematic Kung Fu instructor/actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) played the lead role's master If you get the chance to see this in cinema do it, you'll probably have a good and intense experience and I don't know if this works on small screen as well
SarahBrown	testing	Judy Davis	One of those few is ██████████, who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart.
SarahBrown	testing	Davis	In that film, █████ played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world, despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing.
SarahBrown	testing	Gillian Armstrong's	███████████████████ films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other, but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions.
SarahBrown	testing	Leopold	For instance, in one scene, ███████ calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen.
SarahBrown	testing	Ravensteins	One of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ███████████ on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with facial close ups.
SarahBrown	testing	gore	It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much ████.
SarahBrown	testing	Katharina	Same with the scene when █████████ finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side.
SarahBrown	testing	Von Trier	It is one of the things I love about █████████, his understatement of horror, which ends up making it all the more creepy.
SarahBrown	testing	Leo	Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as ███'s uncle.
SarahBrown	testing	Leo	Yet some people, like ███, are tuned in, but do nothing positive about it.
SarahBrown	testing	Max von Sydow	The voice over, done expertly well by █████████████, is amusing too.
SarahBrown	testing	Bjork	I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where █████'s character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction.
SarahBrown	testing	Von Trier	Actually, at one time, █████████ seemed anti-woman to me, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know his male characters don't fare well either!
SarahBrown	testing	Shall	Why they would make a remake of █████
SarahBrown	testing	Lorne Green	███████████ had his defining iconic character from this series.
SarahBrown	testing	John Carpenter's	I was very impressed by the original ████████████████ Vampires and when I descovered there was a sequel I went straight out and bought it.
SarahBrown	testing	Zoey	One of my favourite parts was just after he meets ████ and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems.
SarahBrown	testing	Christian Petzold	"""Gespenster"" (2005) forms, together with ""Yella"" (2007), and ""Jerichow"" (2008), the Gespenster-trilogy of director █████████████████, doubtless one of the creme-De-la-creme German movie directors of our time."
SarahBrown	testing	Gespenster	"Roughly, ""██████████"" tells the story of a French woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in Berlin - and has never been seen ever."
SarahBrown	testing	Marie	As we hear later in the movie, the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter █████.
SarahBrown	testing	Nina	However, this time, when she meets ████, everything comes quite different.
SarahBrown	testing	Nina	After what we have witnessed in the movie, it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves ████ alone.
SarahBrown	testing	Gespenster	"in ""Umberto D.""), but in ""██████████"", it is displaced."
SarahBrown	testing	Gespenster	Despite our modern, Aristotelian world, the superstition, conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality, and that individuality, therefore, is not something erratic, but rather diffusional, so that the borders between persons are open, such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of ██████████ of the most interesting kind.
SarahBrown	testing	Oscar	Overall, well worth seeing especially given the issues covered but don't expect █████ material.
SarahBrown	testing	Jabba	█████.
SarahBrown	testing	Jenny Hanahan	█████████████
SarahBrown	testing	Suraj Barjatya back	It is nice to see ███████████████████ at what he is best at.
SarahBrown	testing	Sanders	███████ joins in the fun simply by dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting falling on both him and the first killer (at the right time!) and killing him.
SarahBrown	testing	Waldeman	The story and acting's OK, the only gripe I've got is near the end with the hurried and almost laughable discovery of who the evil genius (████████) was - did they almost forget about his relevance in the plot?
SarahBrown	testing	Dickens	As a lifelong fan of ███████, I have invariably been disappointed by adaptations of his novels.
SarahBrown	testing	Oliver Twist	At the time of writing, ████████████ is being dramatised in serial form on BBC television.
SarahBrown	testing	Dickens	It's not really ███████ at all.
SarahBrown	testing	Oliver	'██████!', on the other hand, is much closer to the mark.
SarahBrown	testing	Brownlow	The classic stand-off between the beadle and Mr ████████, in which the law is described as 'a ass, a idiot' couldn't have been better done.
SarahBrown	testing	Harry Secombe	█████████████ is an ideal choice.
SarahBrown	testing	Dickens	Otherwise, very few liberties are taken with ███████'s original.
SarahBrown	testing	Mark Lester	███████████ mimes his wonderfully.
SarahBrown	testing	Dickens	It's schmaltzy, but it's ███████ through and through.
SarahBrown	testing	Scrooge	I ought to give it 10 points, but I'm feeling more like ███████ today.
SarahBrown	testing	Lugosi	██████ plays the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends.
SarahBrown	testing	Lucy Walker	The characters are fully developed through the truth in which Director, ███████████ brings to the film.
SarahBrown	testing	Lucy Wlaker	███████████ showcases the landscape beauty.
SarahBrown	testing	Lucy	Thank you ████ for being true to your vison as a filmmaker.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	In the beginning, ███████ is not too different from his dishonest and brutal business partner, Carface.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	Carface's method of revenge is through murder, while ███████ believes success is the best revenge, financial success that is.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	They win a whole bunch of races, and ███████ tells her he'll give the money to the poor - hint hint: Charlie and Itchy live in a junkyard, and are therefore poor.
SarahBrown	testing	Anne Marie	The reason why ██████████ has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion, and she listens carefully.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	She teaches ███████ ethics by pointing out his gambling, lying, and stealing.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	███████ tries to make up for it by buying her dresses.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	She added the ethics that his business needed, while ███████ did management, and Itchy provided construction.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	Carface uses violence and property damage to tear down ███████'s business, which is unprotected by the government.
SarahBrown	testing	Charlie	███████ loses everything and all he has left is this little girl.
SarahBrown	testing	Rock Hudson	███████████ basically phoned in his performance, but he is passably good.
SarahBrown	testing	Julie	A real curiosity item in that it was the last major film █████ did for about 10 years and, in many ways, is a precursor to Victor/Victoria.
SarahBrown	testing	Ulysses	███████ as a film should in no way be compared with the novel, for they are two entirely different entities.
SarahBrown	testing	Greg Kinnear	I enjoyed seeing ████████████ as the host.
SarahBrown	testing	Valentine	Yet again unlike Urban Legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes █████████ the best.
SarahBrown	testing	Jessica Cauffiel	My favourite is ████████████████ who is killed within the coolest way to be killed.
SarahBrown	testing	Katherine Heigl	███████████████ is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables.
SarahBrown	testing	Denise Richards	███████████████ is killed third, while she just found a Valentines' Day gift for her at a whirlpool bath.
SarahBrown	testing	Jessica Capshaw	███████████████ is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer.
SarahBrown	testing	Marley Shelton	██████████████ is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know, 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed.
SarahBrown	testing	Dorothy	The third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene, the Valentines' Day celebration at ███████'s house scenes and ultimately the killing themes.
SarahBrown	testing	Paul Ryan	█████████, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast.
SarahBrown	testing	Alicia Browning	███████████████ is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school.
SarahBrown	testing	Alicia	██████ was among the students in the home room where nine students have died, supposedly killed by her boyfriend.
SarahBrown	testing	Alicia	██████, we realize, is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life, but we are not given any clues to that effect.
SarahBrown	testing	Deanna Cartwright	█████████████████ is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn't have been at the school, at all.
SarahBrown	testing	Alicia	██████ is made to go to the hospital by the school principal.
SarahBrown	testing	Deanna	Since she doesn't cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see ██████ in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows.
SarahBrown	testing	Ryan	The film has an intensity because it's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred, which helps the tone that Mr. ████ wanted to give this movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Carmen	From the beginning of the show ██████ was there.
SarahBrown	testing	Carmen	The best episodes were with ██████ in them.
SarahBrown	testing	Lion	I watched ████ king more times that all my friends put togther.
SarahBrown	testing	Red Buttons	███████████ is great...
SarahBrown	testing	Stephen King's	"Offbeat and rather entertaining sleeper concerning two very different brothers who are both not only so-called ""fire starters"" (think ██████████████ snore-fest of a book with the same name), but also forever at odds with each other over a woman who has a rather nasty habit of being a pyromaniac!"
SarahBrown	testing	Jack O'Neil	 ███████████ takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate.
SarahBrown	testing	O'Neil	They have some of course but thanks to ██████ who likes to keep a simple terminology, there's not many.
SarahBrown	testing	Erika Christensen	█████████████████, though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting.
SarahBrown	testing	Christensen	Busy Philipps, three years older than ███████████ and altogether unknown to me, blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence.
SarahBrown	testing	Gus van Sant's	██████████████ Elephant (2003) though good, seems almost superficial and paltry compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting.
SarahBrown	testing	Beckham	Not being a Manchester United fan, the mere mention of ███████ was a bit off putting, however I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did.
SarahBrown	testing	Elmer Fudd	But make no mistake, it's quite hilarious what Bugs Bunny does to the eternally gullible ██████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Oscar	Sick of the current cinema output, particularly American cinema, I've been making an effort to see the █████-winning foreign films.
SarahBrown	testing	Tatyana Samojlova	Why █████████████████ as the young woman didn't become an international star after this is beyond me(though she has remained successful in her own country).
SarahBrown	testing	Tatyana	And the beauty of it (like when ███████'s character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence).
SarahBrown	testing	Georges	The opening sequence is excellent where ███████ relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover what God created on the eighth day.
SarahBrown	testing	Harry	There are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for █████.
SarahBrown	testing	Georges	For example, ███████ who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and hasn't enough money.
SarahBrown	testing	Down	I liked the scene where the ████'s Syndrome group on a trip to the Art Gallery escape on a bus and gate-crash the Paradis fun park.
SarahBrown	testing	Isaac Asimov's	"It shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: ""1984"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey (compare its space station with our International Space Station) and ██████████████ ""I Robot"" (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's)."
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	Once her father died, ██████████'s stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house, like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	Of course, ██████████ didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	██████████ was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball, until her fairy godmother appeared.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	So she did some magic and made ██████████ into a beautiful woman, but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	While at the Royal Ball, ██████████ loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	The duke searched every house, but finally found the women who it belonged to, ██████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	In the beginning of the film ██████████ was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her, but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love.
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	I also loved the part when ██████████ and the Prince were singing the song
SarahBrown	testing	Cinderella	I first saw ██████████ was when I was five years old.
SarahBrown	testing	Patty Duke	██████████?
SarahBrown	testing	george lopez	but ████████████ is a surprisingly good show.
SarahBrown	testing	max	but ███ is a fun character, and acted well.
SarahBrown	testing	angie	and yeah, █████ is a little stereotypical, but she has her funny moments.
SarahBrown	testing	Archer Coe	Populated with suspicious characters, all connected to a dog show and all having very good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim ██████████, it's truly tough to figure this one out or wrap one's head around it but boy, does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us.
SarahBrown	testing	Etienne Girardot	I particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner (played by ████████████████), who is always it seems to him being rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one's running time.
SarahBrown	testing	Eugene Palette's	Also ████████████████ Detective Sgt.
SarahBrown	testing	Kirk	In this episode, ████ decides to grant his crew some time off, and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation.
SarahBrown	testing	Granger	███████ can see the end is near, and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt-on the herds, the Indians and the land itself.
SarahBrown	testing	Taylor	██████, on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo, or Indians to 'being with a woman.'
SarahBrown	testing	Nolan	There's not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story moves along quickly, and we are treated to a fine character performance by █████.
SarahBrown	testing	Taylor	Considering when this was made, the Censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the 'bawdy house', ██████'s relationship with the squaw, and much of the dialogue.
SarahBrown	testing	Williams	Bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the ████████ family, living in the California desert.
SarahBrown	testing	M.R. James	I saw that it was being repeated again on BBC 4, and decided to give it a go, remembering the BBC's successful 1970's adaptations of other ██████████ stories including '
SarahBrown	testing	Gallows Hill	But what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named ████████████?
SarahBrown	testing	Thierry	Zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with ███████.
SarahBrown	testing	Thierry	███████ himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way.
SarahBrown	testing	Johnny	But ██████ has kept on painting, and just have a day job for the rent.
SarahBrown	testing	Johnny	There is an instant raw attraction between Zandalee and ██████, and they enter into an affair.
SarahBrown	testing	Erika Anderson	But the show is almost completely stolen by ██████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Elly	It is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why ████ is such a recluse.
SarahBrown	testing	Eric	The last season was just not right, ████ was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves.
SarahBrown	testing	John Wayne's	The best film on the battle of San Antonio, Texas in March 1836, was ████████████ 1960 epic THE ALAMO.
SarahBrown	testing	Wayne	In a one shot job as director producer, that temporarily financially strapped him, █████ demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon-like acting ability personifying the West.
SarahBrown	testing	Wayne	█████ worked hard to cast it properly, thinking of many people for lead roles in it.
SarahBrown	testing	Antonio De	But, he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces, General ██████████ Santa Anna.
SarahBrown	testing	Ruben Padilla	The role was played by an obscure actor, █████████████ (on this board, his thread shows only three credits listed).
SarahBrown	testing	Raul Julia	██████████ was a wonderful stage actor.
SarahBrown	testing	Santa Anna's	Nothing is acceptable that does not fit ████████████ wishes or activities.
SarahBrown	testing	Santa Anna	██████████ was President of Mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855.
SarahBrown	testing	Benito Juarez	No political figure or military figure would rise to override him until █████████████ did in the late 1850s.
SarahBrown	testing	Fannin	His massacre of Col. ██████'s men at Goliad was inexcusable (one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the Alamo who were fighting to the last, but Fannin had surrendered).
SarahBrown	testing	Franklin Pierce's	"He would be President for the last time in 1853, in time to give █████████████████ horrendously bad administration it's one moment of glory - Santa Anna sold the border of Arizona and New Mexico (the ""Gadsden Purchase"") to the U.S."
SarahBrown	testing	Santa Anna	 Julia's ██████████ is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became America's best land purchase agent.
SarahBrown	testing	David Ogden Stiers	Most of the time his chief aide, Col. Black (██████████████████, here a British born officer) holds his tongue - he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be.
SarahBrown	testing	Santa Anna	At the end, when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead Alamo defenders, Stiers suggests that they tell the world what ██████████ is really like.
SarahBrown	testing	Geraldine	They fall in love,to the horror of her social-mountaineering mother (█████████ James).A wonderful love story, whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral.
SarahBrown	testing	Nabakov	But in spite of its origins in a ███████ story, it certainly is not .The romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands down.
SarahBrown	testing	Coen Bros	"""The Big Lebowski"" proves that he is not dependant on █████████ films to assert his stature."
SarahBrown	testing	Marty McFly	One of them is wearing a ███████████ costume, another is a Ghostbuster, a third is in a House Atreides uniform, and a fourth is wearing a Last Starfighter flightsuit.
SarahBrown	testing	Larry	All of the lions are interesting, although █████ can get annoying at times.
SarahBrown	testing	Spielberg	It may not be as witty as █████████'s classic TV series, but it's still good.
SarahBrown	testing	Eric Williams	"The Wooden Horse was one of the first ""great"" escape stories from World War II, telling the true story of █████████████ and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October of 1943."
SarahBrown	testing	Peter	The taunt drama of █████ and John trying to escape from Germany during the war is more realistic than the treck of the escapes portrayed in the Great Escape.
SarahBrown	testing	von Trier	In 50 years, when █████████ retires, he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet), and there will be classes taught in his name.
SarahBrown	testing	Max von Sydow's	This is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: ███████████████ narration.
SarahBrown	testing	von Trier	We are hypnotized, or █████████ is hypnotized, and this is our/his subconscious mind.
SarahBrown	testing	von Trier's	So the key to interpreting Europa, almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime, is that we are deep in our/███████████ subconscious, and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone.
SarahBrown	testing	Sammo Hung	This is one excellent ██████████ movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Sammo Hung	██████████ proves here that he's probably the best fight choreographer in the business.
SarahBrown	testing	Lau Kar Leung	the fight w/ █████████████ and the finale.
SarahBrown	testing	Dicken	This is the best film version of ██████'s classic tale.
SarahBrown	testing	Edward Woodward	"My biggest surprise is ███████████████, ""the Equalizer"", as the Ghost of Christmas Present."
SarahBrown	testing	Yasmin bleeth	I must say though, █████████████ is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the 3 main guys, coop, remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch
SarahBrown	testing	Pitt	The dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see ████ here makes the film so worth watching.
SarahBrown	testing	George C. Scott	"The only other 2 Ghost Stories to even come close was the ORIGINAL "" The Haunting "" and ███████████████ in "" The Changling "" ."
SarahBrown	testing	Co	Hindi film industry is going shameless with Mallika and ██, this movie is totally vulgarity free and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addicted our Indian society.
SarahBrown	testing	Vipul Shah	I think ██████████ should have given little bit Gujarati touch particularly in music also.
SarahBrown	testing	Anu Malik	█████████ is worst musician around and he thinks himself popstar
SarahBrown	testing	Burt Reynolds	If you love NASCAR and █████████████, this movie is a must-see.
SarahBrown	testing	Burt Reynolds	If you like neither NASCAR nor █████████████, you still should give it a chance, but remember, this movie was far away from winning an Oscar Academy Award.
SarahBrown	testing	Bourne	██████ doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past.
SarahBrown	testing	Bourne	The film starts out in a flurry as ██████ is running from the Moscow police.
SarahBrown	testing	Bourne	The time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that ██████ is remembering things.
SarahBrown	testing	BASEketball	The one and only thing I didnt like about ███████████,was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie,but,if the kid wasnt in the movie,some of the funny scenes wouldnt have existed.
SarahBrown	testing	Boyer	Viewers who've read the accounts of █████'s toupee (it kept coming unstuck in the heat) will snicker every time it makes an appearance.
SarahBrown	testing	Dietrich	████████'s costumes are out of this world.
SarahBrown	testing	Lola Run-A	██████████ German film that integrates it's techno score ingeniously.
SarahBrown	testing	Kurt Russell's	██████████████ acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding.
SarahBrown	testing	Dominic Monaghan	████████████████ really became the insomniac.
SarahBrown	testing	Tamako	██████ is such a wonderfully delightful character.
SarahBrown	testing	Aoki	████'s character is both hilarious and pitiful.
SarahBrown	testing	Masako	██████ is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife, you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right.
SarahBrown	testing	Christopher Walken	Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Christopher Walken	In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Walken	██████ and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.
SarahBrown	testing	Walken	This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads ██████ to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.
SarahBrown	testing	McBain	██████ is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh, and action packed too.
SarahBrown	testing	Walken	This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could ██████ shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window?
SarahBrown	testing	Jim Belushi	When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together for movie night, there's one movie they insist on watching over and over again: You guessed it, K-911, the third installment in the highly successful K-9 franchise starring everybody's favorite TV dad, ███████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Belushi	Some nay-sayers say ███████ ran out of steam with this third movie in the series.
SarahBrown	testing	Belushi	I won't give away the plot, but I will say that ███████ and his panting partner give their best performance yet - one that will have you HOWLING with laughter!
SarahBrown	testing	John Belushi	It's a shame ████████████ isn't alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world.
SarahBrown	testing	Luis Denard	This story deals with a Republican Courier, ███████████ who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations.
SarahBrown	testing	Victor Francen	The real bad guy in this film is ██████████████, (Licata)
SarahBrown	testing	Humphrey Bogart	Great Classic 1945 film without ███████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	La Maman	Unlike many of you I have only seen ████████ et La Putain twice.
SarahBrown	testing	Robert Downey	█████████████, Jr. is excellent in this movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Samantha Carter	Through the first two episodes, we meet ███████████████, a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her, and there is Teal'c, a quiet, compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team.
SarahBrown	testing	Jaffa	The warriors behind the Gouald are called █████, who house the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until the Gouald can get inserted in a person's brain.
SarahBrown	testing	Sam	Through the episodes, we mostly get to see SG-1, the exploratory team comprised of Jack/Daniel/Teal'c/and ███, go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets (this device is called the Stargate) and they encounter new cultures or bad guys.
SarahBrown	testing	Pierce Brosnan	It is a wacky film with an unforgettable character, played to perfection by ██████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Danny Wright	After coming to realization that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbles into a Mexican hotel bar one night and runs into ████████████ (Kinnear).
SarahBrown	testing	Danny	█████ is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him.
SarahBrown	testing	Brosnan	This is ███████'s film.
SarahBrown	testing	Brosnan	███████ may be cinema's ultimate charmer, but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date.
SarahBrown	testing	Oscar	I wouldn't be averse to seeing an █████ nod for this role.
SarahBrown	testing	Brosnan	And it contains a career-defining role for ███████ as the lonely hit-man looking for normalcy, friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life.
SarahBrown	testing	TC Candler	██████████ of IndependentCritics.com
SarahBrown	testing	Val	Holly being the younger one has some teenage problems on the other hand her sister ███ has job,boy friend,fiancé problems like most of the women on the planet.
SarahBrown	testing	Amanda Bynes	I still watch the reruns time to time:) ████████████ is very talented.
SarahBrown	testing	Jenny Garth	███████████ may be new to comedy but she plays really well.
SarahBrown	testing	Gary	████ is a natural talent and makes you laugh each time he shows up.
SarahBrown	testing	Tina Holly	With ██████████ found a real friend and i really like them hanging out.
SarahBrown	testing	Lauren	██████ character is so funny
SarahBrown	testing	MacGyver	Sort of like ████████ would have been had it been in England 80 years earlier...
SarahBrown	testing	MacGyver	I've often wondered if the creators of ████████ saw these shows.
SarahBrown	testing	Glenda Jackson	Before she went into politics or public service, ██████████████ was one of Britain's finest film actresses.
SarahBrown	testing	Glenda	You can't help but watch ██████ play a dowdy housewife and the first true love of the Captain but they came from different classes.
SarahBrown	testing	Glenda	It's not the greatest movie but it's good to see ██████'s amazing talent.
SarahBrown	testing	Margaret Grey	She makes █████████████ into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her.
SarahBrown	testing	Khouri	For the initial portion of the film, ██████ presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in Amman, the story of the book.
SarahBrown	testing	Dominic	███████, it turns out, has no fertility problems.
SarahBrown	testing	Siobhan	I expect his sperms do swashbuckling - probably each carries a little sword - and now ███████ is inevitably pregnant that way instead.
SarahBrown	testing	Siobhan	What ███████ should do is to shut up good and tight, and go with - it's a miracle.
SarahBrown	testing	Katie	The father died of cancer and █████, who is a doctor, helped him on his journey.
SarahBrown	testing	Katie	It's not going to end well for █████.
SarahBrown	testing	Jessica	███████ is an experimental lesbian.
SarahBrown	testing	Winterson	"I'll organise one and the guests shall be .. Me!"", which achieves the result but isn't exactly █████████."
SarahBrown	testing	Torv	████'s interpretation of her character is good.
SarahBrown	testing	Shelley Conn	Mind, once she's over the wall, in she happily goes, and unsurprisingly, for ████████████ is so mouth-watering that so would a good percentage of the human race given the chance.
SarahBrown	testing	Trudi	Which brings us to █████, who's a widow.
SarahBrown	testing	gundam series	After seeing so many █████████████, movies, and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Gundam	If you're a ██████ fan, and haven't seen this, you shouldn't be reading this; you should already be watching it right now.
SarahBrown	testing	Neil Simon	First off, I dislike almost all ██████████ movies.
SarahBrown	testing	Neil Simon	When did ██████████ meet my grandmothers?
SarahBrown	testing	Walter Matthau's	Well this is a personal review, and my still living grandmother at age 97 (she even outlived ████████████████ magnificent impersonation of her!)would deny it -- but some of you must find resonance in these characters.
SarahBrown	testing	George Burns	Secondly, I have little tolerance for ████████████, but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances I can recall (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character).
SarahBrown	testing	Sharon	Although ██████ may be 48 years old...
SarahBrown	testing	Barbie	I don't care if she's as fake as a ██████.
SarahBrown	testing	Lester	I liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of ██████... very believable.
SarahBrown	testing	Alfred Junge's	No great coincidence: the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth films; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered, something best passed over in silence, when placed next to ██████████████ vision.
SarahBrown	testing	Powell	██████ dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it's the most natural thing in the world, a mere change of palettes.
SarahBrown	testing	Carter	Perhaps ██████ dreamt up a fantasy that was, as it so happened, true.)
SarahBrown	testing	Abraham Farlan	Consider the scene in which ██████████████ (Heaven's prosecuting lawyer) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match, and contemptuously says, `The voice of England, 1945.'
SarahBrown	testing	Reeves	Dr. ██████ (the defence) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment, and then produces one of his own: a blues song from America, which Farlan listens to as though he's got a lemon in his mouth.
SarahBrown	testing	Reeves	██████ looks smug.
SarahBrown	testing	Powell	Well, I don't see why it's snobbish to condemn blues music - and that's not what ██████ and Pressburger are doing, anyway.
SarahBrown	testing	Reeves	There's something valuable about the song and neither ██████ nor Farlan knows what it is.
SarahBrown	testing	Reeves	██████ probably realises as much.
SarahBrown	testing	Reeves	All English audiences (and all Australian, Indian, etc. audiences as well) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast, too; and that while ██████ understands THAT, he is unable to explain it to Farlan - hence the blues broadcast, which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else.
SarahBrown	testing	David Niven	I found ███████████ a bit cold, without the charisma he would acquire later in his career; but even so, I don't think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began, as this one did.
SarahBrown	testing	Val	Holly goes to live with ███ when their dad is transferred to Japan.
SarahBrown	testing	Val	███ has the perfect life, she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment of the Upper East Side.
SarahBrown	testing	Val	Holly is 16 and is a total free spirit while ███ is the complete opposite.
SarahBrown	testing	Victor Salva	One of the others was Clownhouse directed by ████████████, a movie horribly overlook due to Salva's legal/sexual problems.
SarahBrown	testing	Suzie Kendall	The parts I remember, rightly or wrongly, include Mustard gas in the trenches and █████████████ as a German spy, offering some bloke sexual favours in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him.
SarahBrown	testing	Ebert	I mean, I don't really like █████ on most movies, but this is the movie that I will agree about.
SarahBrown	testing	Steve	█████ did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny.
SarahBrown	testing	Zizek	As usual, █████ delivers complex ideas with gusto and in a convincing manner.
SarahBrown	testing	Zizek	█████ is a phenomenon and pop icon unto himself.
SarahBrown	testing	Natasha Ryan	But their youngest daughter (████████████) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc.
SarahBrown	testing	David Allen	Mixing in elements of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, THE DAY TIME ENDED, despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting, remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of ███████████.
SarahBrown	testing	John 'Bud' Cardos	I give credit to director █████████████████, whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS made for an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA, for at least trying--and on that basis, I give THE DAY TIME ENDED a 7 out of 10.
SarahBrown	testing	Grimms	Any child old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this heartfelt and humorous re-write of the ██████' fairytale.
SarahBrown	testing	Jim Boles	After the main credits ( nice to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action footage ) we go to the laboratory of Dr.Simon True ( █████████ ), inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater.
SarahBrown	testing	Kim Darby	( █████████ )
SarahBrown	testing	Kim Darby	█████████ grates though as 'Sandy'.
SarahBrown	testing	Jess	I can really relate to the main character ████.
SarahBrown	testing	Jess	████' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else.
SarahBrown	testing	Basil Rathbone	He writes music, she writes lyrics, and they both work for ██████████████ who can't write either because his wife died (actually she just got fat!).
SarahBrown	testing	Bing	Best scene is the pawn shop number where ████ sings an impromptu number while the swing band gets their instruments out of hock.
SarahBrown	testing	Mary Martin	And this is a rare starring role for Broadway legend, ███████████, and she's quite good.
SarahBrown	testing	Rathbone	And who knew ████████ could be funny?
SarahBrown	testing	Martial Law	The best film of ███████████ series.
