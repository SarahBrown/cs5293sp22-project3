SarahBrown	training	Danny	"The turning point in ""The Matador"" comes about half through the movie when █████, an unsophisticated man from Denver, is sitting in the balcony of his Mexico City hotel, enjoying a quiet moment."
SarahBrown	validation	Danny	█████, who has come to sell his program to a Mexican company, but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract.
SarahBrown	testing	Danny	It's not until some time later, on a cold winter night that the killer appears at █████'s door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson.
SarahBrown	training	E. M. Forster	Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of █████████████ novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992.
SarahBrown	training	Tatyana Samojlova	Winner of the golden palm at Cannes Film Festival, it has an excellent cinematography and performance by █████████████████, the only Russian actor ever to win an award in Cannes for a performance.
SarahBrown	validation	Veronika	She plays ████████, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and without preoccupations, with plans of getting married.
SarahBrown	testing	Veronika	The first scene in the stairs is fantastic, but it isn't the only one, there is later a scene when Veronika attempts committing suicide, and another, in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history, the bombing of ████████'s house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire, to find her apartment completely destroyed.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Mann	A few years ago, a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the ████████████ film 'Heat' on it.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars von Trier	██████████████ woke film noir from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war German photographs I saw.
SarahBrown	testing	Werewolf	Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the ████████, Nazi post-war terrorists.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like ████████ did all throughout the course of the film.
SarahBrown	validation	Stardust	As magically fairy-tale-like as The Princess Bride, ████████ is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's.
SarahBrown	training	IKWYDLS	 Another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl, unlike in SCREAM and ███████ where it was obvious.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	"The most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when █████ can hear and when she can't -- a sort of ""point of hear"" (like point of view)."
SarahBrown	training	Majorcan	I must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors, who managed to sound really ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Logan Bartholomew	"My favorite line in this movie is when █████████████████ says: ""rosy cheeks"", when he is talking about his baby daughter."
SarahBrown	training	Tom Noonan	The incredible performance by ██████████ is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	"█████████████ plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger ""drama"" studio."
SarahBrown	training	Picasso	███████ was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime.
SarahBrown	training	Ruben Santiago-Hudson	LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, engrossing, emotionally-charged HBO-TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor █████████████████████ (who also appears in a small role).
SarahBrown	validation	"Rachel ""Nanny"""	This joyous motion picture experience is centered around Santiago-Hudson's childhood guardian, ██████████████ Crosby, a strong, big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate New York during the 1950's.
SarahBrown	testing	an Emmy Award	Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent, in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	S. Epatha Merkeson	Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored, this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels, but if for no other reason, is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by ██████████████████, who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it.
SarahBrown	training	Thomas Kinkade	"Recently I was pondering a statement made by the artist ██████████████ in one of his inspirational books; He states: ""You and I were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic."
SarahBrown	validation	Kinkade	"Nor do I think God had banal television programs, media hype, worthless purchases, and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe..."" I hadn't seen ""A river runs through it"" in a couple of years, but after pondering ███████'s statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye."
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	But alas, █████████ hasn't improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialog are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys didn't help either).
SarahBrown	training	John Scott Shepard	The first episode, which is going to sound a bit stupid since ██████████████████ has created this situation - both the sister and mother gets pregnant.
SarahBrown	training	Silent Hill	I've played Resident Evil, ███████████ and the Evil Dead and Castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements.
SarahBrown	validation	Barker	██████ is good at what he does, which is attach the horror to our world, and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	███████ takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements.
SarahBrown	training	Shahid Kapur -	She has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to ██████████████ who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance.
SarahBrown	validation	Maine Pyar Kiya	Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after ███████████████, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain.
SarahBrown	testing	AMRITA RAO	it seems ██████████ - our actress-from-Vivah {Result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006 !!
SarahBrown	training	Chawla	They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi ██████} .................
SarahBrown	validation	Amrita Rao	 Some points that I observed,few of the elements :- #1 If u notice carefully, ██████████ looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses.
SarahBrown	testing	Anupam Kher	but PREM listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Fanaa	IN FACT - i think Vivah does deserve better viewing/business than Dhoom2 or █████ or Golmaal or all those time-pass/fuzzy/style/crap movies !!
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	I watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I didn't have the best time mainly because I didn't know about █████████ or his story.
SarahBrown	validation	Ned Kelly	But the way █████████ is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true.
SarahBrown	training	Gundam	If you liked 0083 then check this one out, or if you are new to the ██████ world, this is a good show to start with.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	"Those who know who know the █████ ""legend"" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg."
SarahBrown	validation	Naomi Watt's	████████████ character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well.
SarahBrown	testing	Bacchus Marsh	Some location shooting film in the area I live, █████████████ outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	Never mind that someone else may get ████'s file later to supervise his release; for the moment they are free!
SarahBrown	training	Eve Arden	One minor disappointment is █████████ trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything.
SarahBrown	training	Max Von Sydow	The narrator (█████████████) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945.
SarahBrown	training	John 'Drew' Barrymore	█████████████████████ steals the show as the younger, impressionable brother-Barrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	As █████████████ is my most favorite actress and singer by far, I was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is.
SarahBrown	validation	Blake Edwards	This movie is just...great (I'm running out of adjectives!), it's magnificent, marvellous, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad, and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews!And to her husband, director █████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Lili	There meeting was planned by the German Government (I'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them, but you get the point), because the warm, happy, singing entertainer ████ is actually a German Spy.
SarahBrown	training	Horace Greeley	"As the Civil War closes, Lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice, ""Go West, young man,"" which, mercifully, the film didn't erroneously attribute to ██████████████, as a number of others did."
SarahBrown	validation	Wild Bill Hickock	In the meantime, we see █████████████████, who interacts with a small boy, while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the Mississippi.
SarahBrown	testing	Hickock	███████ eventually meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man.
SarahBrown	training	Hickock	As they're waiting for authorities, ███████ is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards.
SarahBrown	training	Hank	But in this one, the expression in his eyes throughout, as ████ considered the things that were happening to him, was wonderful and tender.
SarahBrown	training	Private Benjamin	Like her lightest fare: Protocol, Overboard, Housesitter, Wildcats, ████████████████, Seems Like Old Times, Foul Play, Death Becomes Her, First Wives Club and the remake of Out-of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what she is doing...she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it!
SarahBrown	training	Ella Enchanted	 In case you don't want to read further down the page (there aren't any spoilers), I'll sum it up here: It's more mature than ██████████████ (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds.
SarahBrown	validation	Bourne Ultimatum	By the end here (August), I was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that I averted seeing ████████████████ in favor of Stardust.
SarahBrown	testing	Stardust	Having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by Transformers for my Fiction addiction, the previews of ████████ seemed appealing, but I was certainly wary.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	████████ didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was I sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom.
SarahBrown	validation	Princess Bride	It's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (██████████████, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.)
SarahBrown	training	Preston	The Sundowners is a tightly-paced, gritty, and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by ███████.
SarahBrown	validation	Shane	Here, he comes across as an evil version of █████, that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw's relationship is revealed.
SarahBrown	training	YOKAI DAISENSO	██████████████ takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness, diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	The film is evidently bigger budget than anything else █████ has done, with lots of CGI to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures (the YOKAI).
SarahBrown	testing	Miike	Those looking for another violent, perverted gangster film aren't going to find what they're looking for in YOKAI, but if you're a fan of █████ because of his imagination and wit, there's plenty to satisfy here.
SarahBrown	training	Afrika Bambaata	"It should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing (""This ain't New York, this is the Bronx!""), and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing, dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper ███████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Andrews	"Also it has ███████ doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--""Whistling in the Dark""."
SarahBrown	training	Kimberly Elise's	I enjoyed ████████████████ performance, she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Stewart	This is such a fantastic movie, a Western about a self-concerned man (█████████████) going up to the Klondike for gold.
SarahBrown	validation	John McIntire	On the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska (█████████████, giving a wonderfully evil performance), whom he hassles back.
SarahBrown	testing	McIntire	████████ threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the States.
SarahBrown	training	McIntire	The main chunk of the story is about the peaceful Klondike town of Dawson being turned upside down by new residents from ████████'s town.
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	███████ gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954, Rear Window).
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	His relationship with ███████ is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man.
SarahBrown	training	Rusty	The movie has two questions that █████ must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and Is less really more if you are happy?
SarahBrown	training	Lucy	Had there been more time, had the story been more about ████'s entire life, then maybe the kids woulda been there more.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucy	Wow, that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in ████'s life.
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with ███████████ turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished.
SarahBrown	validation	Luke	The anguishing sequence in that film was when ████ is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious.
SarahBrown	testing	Darth Vader V.s Luke Skywalker	I personally like the script and the battle of Endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of Star Wars between ██████████████████████████████ on the Death Star.
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	"Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ████ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect ""The Empire Strikes Back""."
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	█████' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.
SarahBrown	testing	Darth Vader	His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with ███████████ and his fate.
SarahBrown	training	Leia	In fact only ████'s character is developed in ROTJ, Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.
SarahBrown	validation	Skywalker	The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful █████████ to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?)
SarahBrown	testing	John Williams'	"Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ██████████████ score is as much a part of ""Star Wars"" folklore as light sabers and the Force."
SarahBrown	training	Shemp	It is not only one of the best Stooges films with █████, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced.
SarahBrown	validation	Moe	Other funny scenes: the close-up of ███'s mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.
SarahBrown	testing	Duke York	Nikko the goon (played by █████████) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	Turns out, it wasn't Transformers and I had been aware of it way back when as 'that ███████████ movie'.
SarahBrown	validation	Gaiman	But ██████'s story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Although the movie doesn't have much ████, it is entertaining, and for some reason you kind of care about the characters.
SarahBrown	training	Sunny Davis	It's an interesting adventure with the life of ███████████, who is arranged to marry the king of Ohtar, so that the U.S. can get an army base there to balance power in the Middle East.
SarahBrown	training	Kris Kringle	Complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly ████████████ escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Pollard	███████████████ looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead.
SarahBrown	training	James Stewart	█████████████ here is again a man fighting within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money, and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered.
SarahBrown	validation	Mann	████ is excellent directing the shootouts, but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	Like all of the Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of ███████'s character which is more complex.
SarahBrown	training	Ben Gazzara	He shoots her in loving close-ups, gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled ███████████, and allows her room to sparkle throughout.
SarahBrown	validation	John Ritter's	The love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing, though I did tire of █████████████ TV-styled klutziness.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	Quintessentially British for upholding British heritage (███████████, beer, fair play, good manners), it is also visibly Americanised in its baroque compositions, technical inventiveness and a fine multi-ethnic cast.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter	Resigned to dying, █████ nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour, charm and outpouring confessions, and his warm affiliation with June closes with a mutual exchange of 'I love you.'
SarahBrown	testing	Peter	 Keeping with the magic of the moment, █████, by oversight of his Conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the 'Other World,' escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach.
SarahBrown	training	Peter	But █████ is adamant to live because of June and the Conductor's mistake, and wilfully guards his corner.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter	The unlikely affection shared between █████ and June never turns mushy or verbose; it's treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love, so it can keep them together.
SarahBrown	testing	Peter	 The French Conductor, who can freeze time and people's bodies, obtrudes many of their key moments together, lecturing █████ about history and among his mischievous tricks, pinching Peter's 'Top 100 Game Tricks' book and his coffee cup.
SarahBrown	training	lau kar leung	sammo takes on █████████████ in a casino, sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in.
SarahBrown	validation	lam ching ying	some great and touching moments in the film, ██████████████ pops up in a cameo and gets killed off - gutted.
SarahBrown	training	Greg Kinnear's	██████████████ character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness, but he's given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film's lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later.
SarahBrown	training	Saura	█████ encompasses all Spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors.
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	I only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti-depressant drugs more - the kids from Columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way ██████ popped them every time the nightmares started.
SarahBrown	training	Iwerks	That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where ██████ continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog).
SarahBrown	validation	Iwerks	The bright tonalities allowed ██████ to create a more visually appealing film, and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney, creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before.
SarahBrown	testing	Iwerk	Being a musical film, this is of high importance, and so the mediocrity of the music brings down █████'s flawless work of animation.
SarahBrown	training	Iwerk	"Despite its shortcomings, ""Skeleton Frolics"" is a very funny and visually breathtaking film, that while not exactly the most original and fresh film (one just can't help but thinking of ""The Skeleton Dance"" while watching it), it definitely reminds us that █████'s skeletons are still here to haunt us, and inspire us."
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	As Utopian as it seems, I do believe people like █████████ could help society in many ways in a broader aspect.
SarahBrown	training	Alvin Sanders	"But █████████████, the man who the feds have ""volunteered"" to be implanted with the device, is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while."
SarahBrown	validation	Alvin	█████ even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem.
SarahBrown	training	Harry Beaumont	Dance, Fools, Dance -- one of *four* films that ██████████████ directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long, yet its characters are well developed, its story never seems rushed, and despite its many twists in plot, the audience is never left behind.
SarahBrown	validation	Crawford	Made when she was just 27, this lesser-known version of ████████ will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work.
SarahBrown	training	Tatooine	First we are back on the desert planet ████████, and then we are watching them face ANOTHER death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new...
SarahBrown	validation	Lando	"█████, an interesting character introduced in ""Empire"", here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle."
SarahBrown	testing	Lucas	But on its own, it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and IMHO far superior to any of █████' later productions.
SarahBrown	training	Judd Nelson's	It was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch █████████████ Stanley doing what he does best.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Eustache	"In what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual ""revolution"" (purposefully I use quotations for that word), █████████████ wrote and directed The Mother and the Whore as a poetic, damning critique of those who can't seem to get enough love."
SarahBrown	validation	this Ben-Hur	and I'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else ████████████ length feature has to offer- it's that in order to love, honestly, there has to be some level of happiness, of real truth.
SarahBrown	testing	Whore	 The Mother and the █████'s strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity, the lack of monogamy, while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you've ever seen in a movie.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	At the same time we see a character like █████████, who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past, Eustache makes it so that the film itself isn't pretentious- though it could appear to be-
SarahBrown	validation	Eustache	But as ████████ revels in the dialogs these characters have, sometimes trivial, or 'deep', or sexual, or frank, or occasionally extremely (or in a subdued manner) emotional, it's never, ever uninteresting or boring.
SarahBrown	testing	Jim Jarmusch	This is probably the biggest influence on ████████████, who dedicated his film Broken Flowers to Eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely (and lovingly) in approach from the late Parisian.
SarahBrown	training	Robby Muller's	██████████████ camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental, but surely isn't.
SarahBrown	training	Jack Elams	Its right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff, and goes to ██████████ place trying to goad him into a fight.
SarahBrown	training	Clancy Brown	"Co-star ████████████ (HBO's ""Carnivale"" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins."
SarahBrown	training	Claudio Carvalho	Previous reviewer ████████████████ gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could.
SarahBrown	training	pete	they have some really good actors in this thing.. the head coach guy and the player that likes ████ were very good and the plot has already got me
SarahBrown	validation	Jeremy sumpter	but i don't really understand how they'll keep it stretched for a whole season.. there will probably be some big twist tho..i cant wait till Tuesday.. finally ██████████████ who is he?
SarahBrown	training	Chan-wook Park	As he tends to do, ██████████████ keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters.
SarahBrown	validation	Kim	The acting is superb, particularly OK-vin ███, the gorgeous actress in the female lead role who, at 22, shows a range that is remarkable.
SarahBrown	testing	Oldboy	 If you love real art in horror, or are a fan of ██████ - don't wait for the video, see it immediately.
SarahBrown	training	Mel Brooks-	"and the movies based on the series, the humor relies on ███████████style spot gags and silly comments (namely the ""yes it is"" remarks), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him."
SarahBrown	training	Christian Petzold	"""Gespenster"" (2005) forms, together with ""Yella"" (2007), and ""Jerichow"" (2008), the Gespenster-trilogy of director █████████████████, doubtless one of the creme-De-la-creme German movie directors of our time."
SarahBrown	validation	Gespenster	"Roughly, ""██████████"" tells the story of a French woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in Berlin - and has never been seen ever."
SarahBrown	testing	Marie	As we hear later in the movie, the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter █████.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	After what we have witnessed in the movie, it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves ████ alone.
SarahBrown	validation	Gespenster	Despite our modern, Aristotelian world, the superstition, conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality, and that individuality, therefore, is not something erratic, but rather diffusional, so that the borders between persons are open, such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of ██████████ of the most interesting kind.
SarahBrown	training	Weir	I think ████ pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style, but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of VHS this goes over the edge.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	"Mostly that humor comes from ███████ as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d.... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: ""I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning, after the navy's left town."""
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price's	███████████████ follow-up to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon, similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit resourceful  showman.
SarahBrown	training	Iris	It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an ████ would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job.
SarahBrown	training	Turturro	"""The Luzhin Defence"" is, in the foreground, a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant (████████) who becomes consumed by the game and, in the background via flashbacks, his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become."
SarahBrown	validation	Watson	"Factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest (██████) and former ""mentor"" (Wilson) respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of Italy's Lake Como and the intensity of high chess play."
SarahBrown	training	Quincy Jones'	This film captured my heart from the very beginning, when hearing █████████████ first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows.
SarahBrown	validation	Spielberg	The whole cast gives the best performance in a film I've seen in years and █████████ has really outdone himself!
SarahBrown	testing	Danny Glover	The always sympathetic, charming ████████████ makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard	Writer/director ███████████████ very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions, turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk), using visuals as sensory reactors as well.
SarahBrown	training	Ekin Cheng	The storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in (I guess ██████████ pulls the girls
SarahBrown	training	Nick Mancuso	I watch most movies that ████████████ is in because, frankly, I love the guy, even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie (long-time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick).
SarahBrown	validation	Nick	That being said, it was what it was -- a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon -- and I still like ████.
SarahBrown	training	Yuen Biao	(See also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (█████████ is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	The scene where ███████████ loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas.
SarahBrown	training	Joan	There is nothing else quite like it on television right now either, unless you count ████ of Arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	This is an almost action-less film following ████, an insomniac, as he goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself off a building, and, for a lot of the time, can't tell reality from hallucination.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack	Introduce a talking dog (another hallucination) and children that suddenly appear in ████'s bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there (more hallucination) and you have an interesting, mind boggling, 43 minutes
SarahBrown	training	Ben	They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because ███ made the mistake of opening his big mouth.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	██████████ shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	There is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting: █████ had hoped for a well-groomed, genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and Paul is a coarse, unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk.
SarahBrown	validation	Audiard	Director ███████ wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story: he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments.
SarahBrown	training	Eloise	When I watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd Street, especially the character ██████ who's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle, like Bebe Daniels did in 42nd Street and another performer gets the part and become a star.
SarahBrown	validation	Micheaux	There's even white people watching the entertainment, I wonder where ████████ found them, there's even a scene where there's blacks and whites sitting together at the club, Micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films, he should be commended for such a bold move.
SarahBrown	testing	Moon	There are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast, ████ Over Harlem, Body and Soul, Paradise
SarahBrown	training	Sepia Cinderella	What A Girl, Mystery In Swing, Miracle In Harlem, and ████████████████, that not only has good entertainment but good acting.
SarahBrown	training	Danny Wright	After coming to realization that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbles into a Mexican hotel bar one night and runs into ████████████ (Kinnear).
SarahBrown	validation	Danny	█████ is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him.
SarahBrown	testing	Brosnan	███████ may be cinema's ultimate charmer, but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	And it contains a career-defining role for ███████ as the lonely hit-man looking for normalcy, friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	Although I've long been a fan of ██████████, I hadn't watched any of his Australian movies until I watched The Last Wave.
SarahBrown	validation	David	For █████'s peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence.
SarahBrown	testing	Weir	Out of little events ████ manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression, suggesting future horrors without really showing anything.
SarahBrown	training	PJ Soles	I've never been a fan of ████████ and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who the Ramones were until she filmed this movie, but I can ignore her snarly little face for the most part.
SarahBrown	training	Tadashi	The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played ███████'s tormentors were not up to the job.
SarahBrown	training	Terry Gilliam	Probably a bit much for normal American kids, and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film, this movie reminded me a quite a bit of Time Bandits - very █████████████ all the way through.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	And while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of █████'s work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn poignant.
SarahBrown	training	Letyat	"If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war, you need to see ""██████ zhuravli"" (called ""The Cranes are Flying"" in English)."
SarahBrown	validation	Boris	█████, meanwhile, continues trotting through the countryside, fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war, until he he runs out of energy.
SarahBrown	testing	Boris	When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news, she refuses to accept it, until █████' body arrives home on one of the trains.
SarahBrown	training	pre-Mussolini Italian	I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful █████████████████████ atmosphere.
SarahBrown	validation	Boccaccio	(Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from █████████'s Decameron on TV.)
SarahBrown	testing	Mike Newell	Great credit is due to the Director, ███████████, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies.
SarahBrown	training	Al	By the end, little ██ learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice.
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	The scenes of ████████ in the middle of the tanks, or in the train station with many figurants are awesome.
SarahBrown	training	Dennis Leary	It reminds me of the ████████████ joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Vidor	This is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of █████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Jerome Kern's	"█████████████ music is heard through out the entire picture and the song, ""Long Ago & Far Away"" is the theme music for this musical."
SarahBrown	training	Elizabeth Arngrim	From the use of the actual villa that inspired █████████████████ to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right!
SarahBrown	training	Peter Bogdanovich	A charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (█████████████████ is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club).
SarahBrown	training	Rusty	The life of █████ changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine.
SarahBrown	validation	Danny	She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style, missing the love of █████ and her old friends.
SarahBrown	testing	Gene Kelly	My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent ██████████ festival and they loved 'Cover Girl', therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	Also, the disco was taken out of █████'s palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.
SarahBrown	training	Schindler	"A departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for his 1993 success, ""█████████'s List""."
SarahBrown	validation	Menno Meyjes'	While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the fault of continuity and █████████████ scrambling screenplay.
SarahBrown	testing	Walker	This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss ██████'s novel.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	A real shame that maestro █████████ was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director.
SarahBrown	validation	Whoopi Goldberg	Performances are strong throughout, with ███████████████ making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved.
SarahBrown	testing	Danny Glover	"████████████ lends solid support, though his ""Moses"" was a superior turn for him in ""Places in the Heart""."
SarahBrown	training	David Morse	Of course I love everything ███████████ does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were more good things about this film then that.
SarahBrown	training	John Wayne	When ██████████ filmed his Alamo story he had built a complete Alamo set in the town of Brackettsville, Texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction.
SarahBrown	validation	Wayne	Tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films, but Tinkle who was alive back then when the █████ film was done and he was not pleased with the result.
SarahBrown	testing	Antonio De	However the main asset that The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory has is a full blown portrayal of ██████████ Lopez De Santa Anna, the president of Mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the North Americans who've come to settle in Texas at Mexican invitation.
SarahBrown	training	Benito Juarez	He was also quite the scoundrel, but he was the best Mexico produced until a genuine reformer named █████████████ came along.
SarahBrown	validation	John Wayne's	For a romantic telling of The Alamo tale by all means see ████████████ version, but for historical content I recommend this film highly.
SarahBrown	training	Helmer	██████'s solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof... from which he could see his beloved Sweden... to a bathroom.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars von Trier	I recommend this to any fan of ██████████████ and anyone who enjoyed the first Riget and wants more where that came from.
SarahBrown	training	Principal Togar	"(Let me assure you I've been out of high school for, uhhh, some years and it's not following me).....the famous ""static"" line (""I'm getting some static"".....""Not as much as you're going to get"", as Principal Togar approaches).....the school board member who is so decrepit he's attended by nurses....the Nazi Hall Monitors love for a ""body search"" ......███████████████ announcing, ""I give you the final solution"", and burning the Ramones records (note: records were what came before CD's) ...."
SarahBrown	validation	Joey Ramone	Just one piece of advice.....don't look up where the stars are now.....███████████ sadly died young.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dickens'	"You could stage a version of ████████████████ ""A Christmas Carol"" with sock puppets and I'll probably watch it."
SarahBrown	validation	Scott	Impressive as █████'s performance is, the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version's dark beauty.
SarahBrown	testing	Roger Rees	Often portrayed as an affable buffoon, here he is played by ██████████ with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals.
SarahBrown	training	Marley	In most versions of this tale, the scene with ██████ tends to be a bit of a low point in the film, simply because it's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly, and the results are usually just plain silly (ooooh, look, it's a scary ghost.......not!)
SarahBrown	validation	Marley	██████'s entrance, as the locks on Scrooge's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house, is wonderfully creepy.
SarahBrown	testing	Marley	██████ may be a ghost, but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth, and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress, are still very human.
SarahBrown	training	Edward Woodward	███████████████ (remember him from the Equalizer?) is by turns both jovial and menacing as the Ghost of Christmas Present.
SarahBrown	validation	Santa Claus	"When he delivers the famous line, ""it may well be that in the sight of Heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than MILLIONS like this poor man's child"" he is no longer a jolly ███████████ surrogate, but an avenging angel who gives Scrooge a much needed verbal spanking."
SarahBrown	training	Iris	████' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and/or teeth job (even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them).
SarahBrown	validation	Iris	"He cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract, as ████' brother in law does (suggesting that he ""married the wrong sister"")."
SarahBrown	testing	Iris	He does not, as ████ says, conform to the work-eat-sleep routine of everyone else; rather, he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way, in a sort of Bauhaus ideal.
SarahBrown	training	Iris	In fact, organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the Bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find Stanley and ████ having sex.
SarahBrown	training	Walter Matthau	██████████████ can't stop working, the man has never learned to relax, take some time and smell the roses.
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Benjamin	He's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent ████████████████ is finding less and less work for him.
SarahBrown	testing	George Burns	 What hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner ████████████ decided to retire and spend some time with his family.
SarahBrown	training	John McIntire	Along the way they meet the man who runs the gold-crazy town behind a dishonest lawman █████████████...
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	In spontaneous manner, ███████ is lost between the ostentatious saloon owner and the wife-candidate...
SarahBrown	training	Sascha	Vera leans toward a handsome count but, astonishingly, Natalia is more fascinated by ██████, whom she met on a walk.
SarahBrown	validation	Sascha	But, with the concentration that ██████ must give to the chess matches and, with other happenings in his past still causing problems, will he win the heart of Natalia?
SarahBrown	testing	James	█████ gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	I am an avid █████████████ fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Director's Cut version.
SarahBrown	validation	Julie	I would have liked to see the the relationship between █████ and Rock blossom, so that the intense love would be more believable.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	As █████ stands before a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is his silhouette.
SarahBrown	validation	Marlon Brando's	Augmented by Scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing...much like ███████████████ first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW.
SarahBrown	testing	Scrooge	"To put it another way, the ""before"" ███████ is almost as charismatic as the ""after,"" even though he really shouldn't be."
SarahBrown	training	Jonathan Harris	"It's what you might call the ""Doctor Smith"" effect, since ███████████████ used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike)."
SarahBrown	training	Vladimir Navokov	The literary genius of ████████████████ is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice.
SarahBrown	validation	Alexander	The director puts us in check mate with the story of █████████, an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction.
SarahBrown	testing	Nastasya	████████, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves.
SarahBrown	training	Alexander	Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots, its low back cut dresses are lovely, █████████ plays his role sublimely.
SarahBrown	validation	Nastasya	████████ is a great match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her.
SarahBrown	testing	Navokov	The Luzhin Defense elegantly gives ███████ honor, the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.
SarahBrown	training	Tobias Schneebaum	I saw this film at Amsterdam's International Documentary Film Festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and █████████████████, all of whom are lively and outspoken New Yorkers.
SarahBrown	validation	Tobias Schneebaum	Equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship █████████████████ had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist.
SarahBrown	training	Miranda Richardson	It says something when ██████████████████ does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	In WINCHESTER '73 it was the relationship of ███████ to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff Webster	Even before the film properly begins he (as ████████████) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to Seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle).
SarahBrown	testing	Gannon	The problem is that neither Smith nor Bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as ██████ in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money.
SarahBrown	training	Ben	He, ███, and Rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle.
SarahBrown	validation	Dawson	After he is proved right, they go by his route and reach ██████ only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	The performances are dandy here, including ███████ as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough.
SarahBrown	training	Brennan	███████ is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results.
SarahBrown	validation	Calvert	"And ███████ is both a voice of conscience and a frontier ""Gigi"" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman."
SarahBrown	testing	John Ford	Best of all is the Canadian Rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of Monument Valley by █████████.
SarahBrown	training	Mann	████ certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.
SarahBrown	training	John Denver	A Christmas Together actually came before my time, but I've been raised on ███████████ and the songs from this special were always my family's Christmas music.
SarahBrown	training	Albert Finney	Although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (█████████████) that he assists, the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.
SarahBrown	validation	Peter Yates	"The gritty style of ███████████ that worked so well in ""Bullitt"" is again on display, and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence."
SarahBrown	training	Indianvalues	The apt depiction of ████████████ and culture makes the viewer search for his/her roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on life.
SarahBrown	training	Dorothy	I remembered it as very mysterious situations, and a mixture of melancholic things, like the fate of ███████ and the personal future of Bogdanovich.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	The script very accurately follows the story originally penned by ███████, and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere.
SarahBrown	validation	George C. Scott	███████████████ brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of Scrooge, and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts.
SarahBrown	testing	Carol	The superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all the Christmas █████ versions I have seen.
SarahBrown	training	Evelyn	Suddenly ██████ grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs Kitty's doll and then cuts her (the doll's) head.
SarahBrown	training	John Cassavetes's	There is no improvisation (unlike in █████████████████ similar films made in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations.
SarahBrown	validation	Marie	Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character █████ was based on, did too.
SarahBrown	testing	Veronika	The anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by ████████ delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Norman Macleans	Ordinary People 1980) captures the majesty of the Montana wilderness and the strength of the American family in this acclaimed adaptation of ███████████████ classic memoir.
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	While ██████ channels his rebellion into writing, Paul descends a slippery path to self-destruction.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Arthur	The action takes us from an Indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with ███████████ excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives.
SarahBrown	training	Fred	His apology to his nephew ████, so sincere, so moving, it is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself.
SarahBrown	training	Benny Hill	Back in those days (the 90's) their programming consisted of ██████████ reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host.
SarahBrown	validation	Frank Drebin	████████████ is clueless at most times, a terrible driver, a terrible shot, macho yet sensitive and vulnerable.
SarahBrown	training	gundam series	After seeing so many █████████████, movies, and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Gundam	If you're a ██████ fan, and haven't seen this, you shouldn't be reading this; you should already be watching it right now.
SarahBrown	training	Michelle Pfeiffer	(One of the witches is played by █████████████████, who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner.)
SarahBrown	validation	Harry Potter	Wholly positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of ████████████ romps.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	█████████████ somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming.
SarahBrown	training	Furlong	You know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like ███████ is even acting.
SarahBrown	training	RAMO	I love the music performances, the breakdancing makes me wanna spin, ████ makes me wanna throw a piece...
SarahBrown	training	saint jack	"One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else, this is the high point of Bogdanovich's fertile after- ""success"" career, when his best work was truly done (""██████████"", ""at long last..."", ""noises off""."
SarahBrown	training	Woronov	What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and ███████ (who is REALLY enjoying herself).
SarahBrown	training	Luke	When The Empire Srtikes Back ended with encasing of the lovable Rouge Han Solo in Carbonite to be delivered to Jabba the Hut and young ████ reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his Father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	 █████ managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted.
SarahBrown	testing	Lando	We cheer on █████ and the other pilots as they take on the mighty Imperial Fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the Deatn Star to destroy it once and for all.
SarahBrown	training	Vadar	And we watch with bated breath as █████ and the Emperor attempt to turn Luke to the Dark Side while he in turn tries to turn his Father back.
SarahBrown	validation	Vadar	There is more depth and emotion to █████ than I believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that I think is what makes him so accessible.
SarahBrown	testing	Vadar	Without ruining the end too much █████'s final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	Return of the Jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending █████ masterpiece deserves.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that █████ can be proud of.
SarahBrown	training	Anne	This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of ████, a raw recruit, into a police squad stationed in the Baltic area.
SarahBrown	validation	Anne	They are truly down to earth, harsh at times and unforgiving, ████ on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition.
SarahBrown	testing	Anne	As days go by ████ becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating.
SarahBrown	training	Benny	The only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character █████, a 12 year old from a broken family.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Brosnan	I saw this movie while it was under limited release, mainly for the novelty of seeing ██████████████ with a moustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I have seen all year.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	This supernatural ██████████ thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen.
SarahBrown	validation	Chris	As he gets closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, █████, and not least about himself.
SarahBrown	testing	Chris	█████ tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago.
SarahBrown	training	Jack	Having chronic Insomnia, ████ is plagued by hallucinations; causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn't.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack	"We find out interesting things about ████ near the end, and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a ""happily ever after"" Hollywood ending."
SarahBrown	training	Seinfeld	Funny, witty, with a few unexpected twists here and there -- there haven't been a comedy this good since ████████.
SarahBrown	training	Trier	It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and █████ makes use of these abilities.
SarahBrown	training	Currie	Foster, giving one of her most perceptive, affecting and underrated performances to date, is basically the group's den mother who presides over the well-being of both herself and the others; she's especially concerned about the good-hearted, but reckless and self-destructive ██████, whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end.
SarahBrown	validation	Leon Bijou's	████████████ soft, dewy, almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence.
SarahBrown	testing	Currie	"Achingly authentic, engrossing and deeply moving (██████'s grim ultimate fate is very heart-breaking), ""Foxes"" is quite simply one of the most unsung and under-appreciated teen movies made about early 80's adolescence."
SarahBrown	training	Zack	I would have liked to have seen more closure with ████'s death and possibly closure with her husband.
SarahBrown	training	Leopold	For instance, in one scene, ███████ calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen.
SarahBrown	validation	Ravensteins	One of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ███████████ on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with facial close ups.
SarahBrown	testing	gore	It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much ████.
SarahBrown	training	Katharina	Same with the scene when █████████ finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side.
SarahBrown	validation	Von Trier	It is one of the things I love about █████████, his understatement of horror, which ends up making it all the more creepy.
SarahBrown	testing	Bjork	I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where █████'s character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	Actually, at one time, █████████ seemed anti-woman to me, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know his male characters don't fare well either!
SarahBrown	training	Betty Boop's	He wants to get a puppy from ████████████ pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue.
SarahBrown	training	Jamie Foxx	I was actually rather surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, having never really been a ██████████ fan, and having the over-used plot that it has.
SarahBrown	validation	Hudson Hawk	The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, ███████████, 48 Hours, etc. etc. etc.)
SarahBrown	testing	Jamie Foxx	██████████ actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Bush	i do like the ramones, and i suppose if you hate them, then, besides being a avid ████ supporter, you might not like this classic.
SarahBrown	validation	Switchblade Sisters	███████████████████, Fast Times..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High, and the cheesy yet gripping(doesn't seem possible) River's Edge.
SarahBrown	training	Lars Von Trier's	More eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of ████████████████ fantastic horror satire The Kingdom...
SarahBrown	training	Bob McKimson	Director ████████████ offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour.
SarahBrown	validation	Acrobatty Bunny	" Those are the 10 main reasons that keeps ███████████████ as a Bugs Bunny classic and can be found in the ""Bugs Bunny Classics' MGM/UA Video (1989)"""
SarahBrown	training	Willie Clark	His performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Woody Allen	I had no interest in seeing the remake with ███████████, because in no way can it match the original.
SarahBrown	training	Powell	"██████ and Pressburger created a seemingly simple, superbly crafted story - the power of love against ""the powers that be""."
SarahBrown	validation	Goring	It is also a pity that ██████'s comedic talents are rarely seen again on film, except in the wonderful videos of The Scarlet Pimpernel television series from the 1950s.
SarahBrown	testing	Niven	He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of █████, and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters.
SarahBrown	training	Isaac Manuel Francisco Albéniz	"Iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of ██████████████████████████████ (1860-1909) and in particular his ""Iberia"" suite for piano."
SarahBrown	validation	Isaac Albéniz	█████████████ was a great contributor to the externalization of Spanish musical culture -- its re-formatting for a non-Spanish audience.
SarahBrown	testing	Liszt	"His ""Iberia"" suite is an imaginative synthesis of Spanish folk music with the styles of █████, Dukas and d'Indy."
SarahBrown	training	Bolero	He traveled around performing his compositions, which are a kind of beautiful standardization of Spanish rhythms and melodies, not as homogenized as Ravel's ██████ but moving in that direction.
SarahBrown	validation	Flamenco	 Saura's ████████ is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music, singing, dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of Spanish style, the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache -- even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it -- in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion; they just are.
SarahBrown	testing	Vittorio Storaro	In his 1995 Flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers, musicians, and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens, flats, and mirrors arranged by cinematographer ████████████████, another of the Spanish filmmaker's important collaborators.
SarahBrown	training	Flamenco	"In ████████ more than any of Saura's other musical films it's the rapt, intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olé's that is the ""story"" and creates the magic."
SarahBrown	validation	Saura	Because █████ has truly made magic, and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story.
SarahBrown	testing	Albeniz	Iberia is in a similar style to some of Saura's purest musical films: no narration, no dialogue, only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region, beginning with a pianist playing ███████'s music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing.
SarahBrown	training	Alfred Molina	I did have a little trouble with the █████████████ character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen.
SarahBrown	training	Fritz Feld	Even the smallest roles were played to perfection, like ██████████ auditioning for the potato chips commercial.
SarahBrown	validation	Herbert Ross	 Which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film, the direction of the greatly underrated ████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Ross	"████ who previously brought a two person play, ""The Owl And The Pussycat"" to the screen and made a full movie out of it, does it again."
SarahBrown	training	Ben Clark	Here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play, where █████████ comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special.
SarahBrown	training	Maurice Richard	 Back in the 1950s, everyone in the Quebec provinces idolized the Montreal Canadians and their star player, ███████████████, and everyone wanted to be like him.
SarahBrown	validation	Maltin	Maybe to someone who doesn't follow sports at all, like ██████, this situation seems odd and humorous to him...but it's a fact of life or any bit-time sports fan and his favorite team.
SarahBrown	testing	Leonard Maltin's	"This movie was part of the DVD ""████████████████ Animation Favorites From The National Film Board Of Canada."
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	It is not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to █████' universe.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	█████' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly.
SarahBrown	testing	Lucas	I'm glad █████ eventually dropped the idea of making episode VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great bookend to a long, fascinating and captivating saga.
SarahBrown	training	Emile Zola's	"The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case ████████████ ""Thérèse Raquin""."
SarahBrown	training	Larry Drake	What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged, Santa Clause suit wearing psychopath (███████████, perfectly over the top) threatens her life...as well as her precious young daughters.
SarahBrown	validation	Crypt	Most notable for it's escalating suspense and narrative twists, And All Through The Houst is among Tales From The █████'s best.
SarahBrown	training	Maurice	"Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for the Canadians AND ███████ ""the Rocket"" Richard."
SarahBrown	training	William Haines	"""Wisecracker,"" the biography of actor ██████████████, offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies."
SarahBrown	validation	Marion Davies	The old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films, but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a Los Angeles museum screening of SHOW PEOPLE, the late silent feature in which he co-starred with █████████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Haines	Beforehand, ██████ was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter, but he was pleasantly surprised (and no doubt relieved) at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	SHOW PEOPLE also stands as the best surviving work of █████████████, a first-rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes.
SarahBrown	validation	Vidor	By the late '20s, for whatever reason, Marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies (including THE RED MILL and THE PATSY), but SHOW PEOPLE, directed by the great King █████, stands as her most enjoyable showcase.
SarahBrown	testing	belle Peggy Pepper	Marion plays Southern ██████████████████, an aspiring actress who storms Hollywood accompanied by her father, determined to become a movie star.
SarahBrown	training	Peggy	"Joy!"") and drops a handkerchief across her face, █████ assumes the appropriate expression and posture."
SarahBrown	validation	Mack Sennett's	Of course, Comet is intended as a take-off of ██████████████ Keystone, but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds.
SarahBrown	training	Chan-wook Park's	I'm the first to recognize that ████████████████ Thirst is exceptionally well made, but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	Instead of legitimately dying, █████ becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).
SarahBrown	testing	Hyeon	Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torturous death if exposed to █████ for a length of time.
SarahBrown	training	Kang	Tae-joo admits(..though a slip of the tongue)that, in fact, ████-woo never hurt her, and as she thirsts for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesn't bother her morally or psychologically.
SarahBrown	validation	Hyeon	Innocent people die because of █████'s love(..what once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the end)for Tae-joo, and it will cease to end if he doesn't make a painful choice.
SarahBrown	testing	Hyeon	"█████, seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening, accepts ""hell"" for Tae-joo so one could look at Thirst as a unique love story, but not exactly a healthy one."
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Quinn	Look out for a very young █████████████ essaying the role of an Indian brave who participated at the battle of Little Big Horn.
SarahBrown	training	Poirot	That said, the ██████ mysteries vary in quality, but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe.
SarahBrown	validation	Poirot	With the singular exception of The Five Little Pigs which was fabulous in plot, character and theme, the longer ██████ films are neither that good or that bad.
SarahBrown	testing	Hastings	Finally, films without Lemon, ████████, and/or Japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence.
SarahBrown	training	Kinnear	"This is a fun movie, with very good scenes (a riveting, on-the-edge Brosnan and a good, compliant ""off""-the-edge ███████ have some good lines)."
SarahBrown	validation	Davis	"My only cavil is that Hope █████, playing the oh-so-tolerant wife (""Can I see your gun?"") doesn't appear more often: she could have been a marvellous foil to these men."
SarahBrown	training	Merkerson	 But make no mistake; see this film for the amazing performance of █████████, who is brilliant in this role.
SarahBrown	training	the Muppet Show	It has been noted elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances on ███████████████, and they did more than one special together.
SarahBrown	training	Winfrey	Since I'm from Chicago, I had already known ███████ from her talk show (which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide).
SarahBrown	validation	Spielberg	Why Academy voters were so hard on not nominating █████████ for Best Director is a mystery that still puzzles me today.
SarahBrown	testing	Spielberg	"But █████████ would eventully go on to win two Oscars years later for ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", making him one of the best movie directors of all-time."
SarahBrown	training	Lesley Brookes	One of the dancers, Maurine (██████████████) is determined to better herself and is going to audition for Vanity's Golden Wedding Cover Girl Competition.
SarahBrown	validation	Rusty	In a very funny scene Maurine has just had a so so audition and seeing █████, gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges!!!
SarahBrown	testing	Hayworth	"""Poor John"" is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations - ████████ looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit."
SarahBrown	training	Rusty	"After a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of America's top magazines, █████ bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy ""Cover Girl"" song."
SarahBrown	training	Leo	His uncle, who works on the railroad, gets ███ a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas.
SarahBrown	validation	Uncle Kessler	These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and the woman's █████████████ postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs.
SarahBrown	testing	Eddie Constantine	Another guest at the house is █████████████████, an actor with a quiet strength, playing a somber American intelligence man.
SarahBrown	training	Leo	Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades, but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than ███, who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars Von Trier	The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director, ██████████████, whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography.
SarahBrown	testing	Max von Sydow's	And most metaphysically affecting of all, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as ███████████████ voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him, and abandon our personal restraint.
SarahBrown	training	Bogdanovich	███████████ wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet, that reality never brings it crashing down to earth.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	██████████, who was on loan to Columbia from MGM, matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Eustache	Unfortunately, █████████████ (1938-1981) belongs like so many once leading French film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international DVDs.
SarahBrown	validation	Alexandre	"It is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas, but the type of man █████████ exists to all times, we find him already in Petron's ""Satiricon"", which work has actually great resemblance with ""The Mother and the Whore""."
SarahBrown	testing	Alexandre	█████████ does not only nothing, but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting, at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is.
SarahBrown	training	Nietzsche	He is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between █████████ and Bernanos.
SarahBrown	validation	Alexandre	However, the intellectual speeches of █████████ seem to be rather pseudo-intellectual, and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective books.
SarahBrown	training	Puss	His acting style fits the role very well as the devious, mischievous ████ who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan he's thought about seven or eight moves in advance.
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	I find it surprising that ████ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted.
SarahBrown	validation	ROTJ	To me it seemed like ████ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie.
SarahBrown	testing	ROTJ	but I think it is slightly less good than than ████ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ████ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole.
SarahBrown	validation	Darth Vader	Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because ███████████ was revealed I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely.
SarahBrown	testing	Chewbacca	How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, █████████, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!!
SarahBrown	training	ROTJ	On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ████ does not get as many accolades as it deserves.
SarahBrown	validation	Luke	"Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as ""just another sequel"") to trash the movie such as ""This movie stinks because ████ is not in it!"""
SarahBrown	testing	ROTJ	then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ████ suffered unfortunately.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	But Paul sees a grander opportunity with █████'s skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	█████ grows more powerful, professionally as well as personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us.
SarahBrown	testing	Carla	 You will hear the world through █████'s ears, from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid, muffled sounds, all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who's talking.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Chow's	It is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to █████████████ Shaolin Soccer.
SarahBrown	validation	Louis Koo(Red	"He teams up with █████████████) who i was very impressed by his flexible ""wing"" which deflected incoming attacks."
SarahBrown	training	Heath Leger	I thought that this film was very well made, ███████████ was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless.
SarahBrown	validation	Ned Kelly	Maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and I did find it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for █████████ NOT to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought?
SarahBrown	training	Lilja	"Last year I saw ""█████ 4-ever"" that tells an identical story in the former Soviet Union; therefore this problem does exist in Third World countries."
SarahBrown	validation	Rudi Lagemann	Director and writer █████████████ presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes.
SarahBrown	testing	Fernanda Carvalho	It is the debut of the promising █████████████████, who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival.
SarahBrown	training	Darlene Glória	Most of the prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous ██████████████ so different she is after many plastic surgeries.
SarahBrown	training	John McIntire	This time he's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by █████████████'s larcenous judge of the Roy Bean school of law and order.
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	While it's no great surprise which way ███████ turns at the end, he's a surprisingly callous critter along the way, even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it's not his problem.
SarahBrown	testing	McIntire	For most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and ████████, something the judge recognises immediately, revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Smith	Thanks to ███████████, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that Return of the Jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch.
SarahBrown	validation	Kevin Smith	Everyone liked Return of the Jedi until someone in a ███████████ movie made a negative comment about it.
SarahBrown	testing	Kevin Smith	This movie is so much better than anything ███████████ ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it.
SarahBrown	training	Chris Martin	With a magnificent soundtrack featuring Faultline & ████████████ and Vama Veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love...
SarahBrown	training	Julie	For example, why is █████ and her uncle suddenly pursued by the Germans when a minute ago she was spying for them.
SarahBrown	validation	Blake	" █████: ""I Will make you a German Spy, then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie."
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	I have to admit that █████████ is one of a kind, you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence.
SarahBrown	validation	Tsui Hark's	"It may have a thin story, but hey look at ███████████ ""Time & Tide,"" we got confused by the plot as well, but it was truly something stylish and awesome."
SarahBrown	training	Alissia	And I never in a million years would have guessed the reason why ███████ had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti-social goth.
SarahBrown	validation	Alissia	This was probably WHY my shirt was soaked because I've experienced that same pain that ███████ was feeling.
SarahBrown	training	James Stewart	This first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement, romance, and █████████████ to the screen.
SarahBrown	validation	Madden	Flippen attempts to arrest ██████ and see that justice be done, but he cannot stand up to him, so he becomes the town drunk.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	If ███████ stays and keeps on not doing anything about it, the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	For a few seconds, his gun, in the gunbelt, is hanging on a post beside his bed, the gun is close up, ███████ is in the background, just inside the door.
SarahBrown	training	Oscars	The idea that it was nominated for 11 ██████ (even Best Picture of the Year) and didn't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can be sometimes.
SarahBrown	training	Norman Maclean	"The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking -- I was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book, ██████████████, ""But when I am alone in the half light of the canyon, all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul, and memories."
SarahBrown	training	Larry Clark	 If this film had been directed by ███████████, then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place.
SarahBrown	validation	Erika Christensen	"The only other movie that I've seen with █████████████████ is ""Swim Fan"" which made me almost not want to watch this film, but she turned in a very good performance herself."
SarahBrown	training	Olivia	There are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter ██████ dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs.
SarahBrown	validation	Olivia	In many ways, ██████ does an outstanding performance as the teenage and Nick Mancuso,(Richard Grant) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner.
SarahBrown	training	Crawford	████████ stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother.
SarahBrown	validation	Crawford	████████ becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on.
SarahBrown	training	Ebenezer Scrooge	That has somehow slipped past one ████████████████, merchant and money lender in 19th century London.
SarahBrown	validation	Scrooge	As his nephew points out to his uncle, he doesn't keep Christmas in any way because ███████ feels the whole thing is humbug.
SarahBrown	testing	Oliver Twist	A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as ████████████ was.
SarahBrown	training	Oliver Twist	The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in ████████████, but they are having to struggle to stay up there.
SarahBrown	validation	Patrick Stewart	███████████████ in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some ████.
SarahBrown	training	Udit Narayan	The actors, the beautiful settings, locations, and surroundings, the deep emotions portrayed, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of ████████████, my favorite) -- everything was just lovely.
SarahBrown	validation	Alok Nath	█████████ is such a terrific actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost steals the show from the young stars.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens England	This is a grand epic of Victorian England, ███████████████ is recreated before our very eyes, the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market.
SarahBrown	validation	Dickens	███████ wrote this story for a dark period in England's life and it's one of the few Christmas tales that is really dark, almost scary, and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around.
SarahBrown	training	Nabokov	"Not having read ███████, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view ""The Luzhin Defence"" as a movie."
SarahBrown	training	Klingon	In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots the Klingon Klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the ███████ is sent to the Starfleet Hospital.
SarahBrown	validation	Soval	The Vulcan ambassador █████ proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of Klaang to his warrior empire in planet Kronos with honor.
SarahBrown	testing	Jonathan Archer	However, Captain ███████████████ proposes to go with the Enterprise in her first voyage and bring back Klaang alive to his home planet.
SarahBrown	training	T'Pol	█████ modifies the sensors of the Enterprise to track the Suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet Riger X.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	The only reason I even found out about this DVD was because ████████████████ is a favorite actor of mine.
SarahBrown	validation	Jack	The film follows ████, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head.
SarahBrown	training	Stormhold	The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between England and a magical kingdom known as █████████.
SarahBrown	validation	The Princess Bride	If I had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be ██████████████████, a classic.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaimans Stardust	This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw █████████████████████ and all I can say is Wow.
SarahBrown	validation	Shrek	The pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be Laugh our Loud funny, Intelligent enough to make the first █████ look like an 80's Sitcom, and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Neil Gaiman	Once again ███████████ has done it, he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it.
SarahBrown	training	Neil	In the end I'm sure that ████'s writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it is easily one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Brosnan	The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by ██████████████ is alone worth the price of admission.
SarahBrown	training	Raul Julia	Another great actor in this move was ██████████, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complex person who led Mexico through turbulent times.
SarahBrown	training	David Guptil	████████████, a familiar face from several other Australian flicks and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines on trial.
SarahBrown	training	Proust	"And what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with, which is directly inspired by ██████'s ""A la Recherche du temps perdu""."
SarahBrown	validation	Gilberte	"The first woman's name is always Gilberte, and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of ████████ : Veronika is like a ""whore Gilberte"", beautiful like the night, whereas Gilberte was pure, and ""beautiful like the day""."
SarahBrown	testing	Alexandre	"For instance, when Veronika notices the strange way █████████ makes is bed, he answers that he saw it in a movie, and then, that a movie, ""it's made for that, to learn how to live, how to make a bed""."
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	"""La Maman et la putain"" fights against a conception of art ""principaly political"" - see for example the ironical review of a political movie by █████████."
SarahBrown	validation	Alexander	The end of the movie shows the symbolic death of █████████, who is smashes by the heaviness of reality.
SarahBrown	testing	Bresson	"He claims for instance that he ""loves a woman for parallel reasons, because she played in a ███████'s for example""."
SarahBrown	training	Stephenie Meyer's	I think men are prone to hate █████████████████ work (and its offspring) to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated.
SarahBrown	training	Greg Kinnear	Pierce and ████████████ play off each other great, and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time.
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	This is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era of ███████'s career.
SarahBrown	training	Judd Nelson	and all the time we are routing for ███████████ to get away with it, we as the viewers are on his side.
SarahBrown	validation	Judd	████ is one of the scariest villains ever, and he's more realistic, he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors.
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	The ███████ family was comprised of four people, the father, a minister, who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly.
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	His brother, ██████, was the cerebral type, he was touched by emotions that were genuine, and motivated by a set of values that Missoula, Montana concurred with!!
SarahBrown	testing	Maclean	The recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the ███████ brothers, and to a lesser degree, the father!!
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	Breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the ███████ brothers had for life...
SarahBrown	validation	Paul	What this film also points out, is that the younger brother, ████, has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman!!
SarahBrown	testing	Maclean	The seedier side of life prevails in the younger brother's existence, and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the ███████ family!!
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	As most human shortcomings go, the ███████ family made light of turbulent waters, (literally) and thus, established unity as a family, by putting necessary blinders on!!!
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	For ██████, his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook, and precarious resolve!
SarahBrown	testing	Norman Maclean	██████████████ must come to grips with the fact that his life has been fragmented by misunderstandings!
SarahBrown	training	Norman Maclean	██████████████ has become a decrepit octogenarian who is polarized by virtual conclusions to his life!!
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	The people and places which were important in ██████'s life, are now only a bittersweet memory....merely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of Montana's beautiful streams and rivers...
SarahBrown	training	Michael Dudikoff	Notable for MTV-J Julie Brown (not the 'Downtown' one) showing some skin, and a very early part (albiet small) for ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	█████ becomes attracted to Paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for,what seems like,the first time.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: -The Rescue of Han Solo from █████: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.
SarahBrown	training	Toyomichi Kurita	The slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer ████████████████, who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light & warmth.
SarahBrown	validation	Lukas Haas	"██████████, a young actor who I was familiar with from ""Testament"" and ""Witness"", plays a character very much like his other early roles."
SarahBrown	training	Jodie Foster's	██████████████ performance is striking, and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir's	It's intriguing, like all ████████████ stuff, but it's not always as attention-holding as I would have liked.
SarahBrown	validation	Weir)but	I found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me (because they are very well handled by the film's director ████████ at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them.
SarahBrown	testing	Weir	"It starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout (most notably the bizarre, ""belching"" sound design)and strong direction; but it just didn't entertain me like ████'s later films do."
SarahBrown	training	Orlando Bloom	The accents are impenetrable if you're from the US so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it, █████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Soll	████ is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way The South was back then.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of ██████████████ he was only able to do comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Emilio Miraglia	The color is superb in this thriller from ███████████████, who only did one other Giallo, as far as I know.
SarahBrown	training	Sandu	"I think this line of Kiki to █████ says all: ""I want to stop...and if you love me, you will do as I ask you""."
SarahBrown	training	Lee Marvin	"I immediately recognized it as a sendup of the opening credits of ""M-Squad"" starring ██████████, one of my all-time favorite cop shows."
SarahBrown	validation	Muhammed Ali	"The episode was ""Ring of Fear/A Dangerous Assignment"", with its comic references to ""On The Waterfront"", and ""████████████"", but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non sequiturs."
SarahBrown	training	Ronald	Taken from ██████ 'Taking Sides' Harwood, it's a funny and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two very 'actorly' types.
SarahBrown	training	Costner	This doesn't make sense: If she knows the layout so well, ███████ is right, he *should* be the one to leave.
SarahBrown	training	Xica	The only cautionary statement about ████ is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore I would recommend that children under 14 do not watch Xica.
SarahBrown	training	Josie Lawrence	██████████████, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes.
SarahBrown	training	gore	Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII, don't expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, ████, etc.
SarahBrown	training	Miss Lemon	A series of random, seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister's boarding house has ██████████ quite agitated.
SarahBrown	validation	Poirot	And ██████'s fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered.
SarahBrown	testing	Poirot	The major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts, the boarding house, the students, the ripped rucksack, and, of course, ██████'s ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	He also continues to make his signature █████ films outside of these ones, which is very reassuring.
SarahBrown	training	Andie MacDowell	For example, at a scene where the other women's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make ███████████████ dump the young man, would a mature police officer (the other friend of MacDowell) allow her friend to do such a sinister act?
SarahBrown	training	Dee Dee	The band, ███████ especially, always disliked the movie through the 80's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into Ramones shows.
SarahBrown	training	John McKay	Mostly known for directing ██████████ wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty-something friends in a small town in England.
SarahBrown	validation	Andie MacDowell	███████████████ once again thrown by the surrounds of the British (which is where I find she exudes the most) is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man.
SarahBrown	training	Dimitri Shostakovich	"It's ""Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2"" composed by ████████████████████, performed here by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra."
SarahBrown	validation	Alexandre Desplat	The film score by █████████████████ was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz.
SarahBrown	testing	Marleen Gorris	"Director ██████████████ of ""Antonia's Line"" (1996 Academy Award's Best Foreign Language Film from the Netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without its unsettling human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family strives, lovingness and respect."
SarahBrown	training	Natella	"Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and ███████, our three ""protagonists"" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject."
SarahBrown	training	Spencer Tracy's	Sandwiched in between San Francisco and Captains Courageous two of ███████████████ greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people.
SarahBrown	validation	Gladys George	The part of the film that gave me some trouble is that I can't believe █████████████ couldn't figure it out.
SarahBrown	testing	James Cagney	She's a street smart girl, her part is very much like the one she played in The Roaring Twenties opposite ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Humphrey Bogart's	Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, █████████████████ character development there is similar to Tone's although he was not the central character of the movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Clint Eastwood's	In fact there are elements of They Gave Him A Gun that are to be found in Taxi Driver and in ████████████████ classic, The Unforgiven.
SarahBrown	training	Mr Courtenay's	"It was a memorable performance that overshadowed ██████████████,reducing him rather to an ""also - ran"" as opposed to an actor on level - billing."
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	"The idea that ""Sir"" and ""██████"" might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window."
SarahBrown	testing	Hari - kiri	When the British cinema virtually committed ███████████ in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door.
SarahBrown	training	Tatyana Samojlova	The girl (a remarkable performance from █████████████████) is also loved by the young man's cousin and, when she doesn't receive word from her boyfriend, gives in to the latter and marries him.
SarahBrown	validation	CUBA	" The only other film I've watched from this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969; albeit via the much-shorter U.S.-release version!), a star-studded international production based on true events; given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING, I regret missing out now on his famous documentary I AM ████ (1964) a number of times when I was in Hollywood late last year: apart from receiving a one-week theatrical run, it was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a feature-length ""Making Of""!!"
SarahBrown	training	Erika Christensen	█████████████████, though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting.
SarahBrown	validation	Christensen	Busy Philipps, three years older than ███████████ and altogether unknown to me, blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence.
SarahBrown	testing	Gus van Sant's	██████████████ Elephant (2003) though good, seems almost superficial and paltry compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier	Now I'd be the first to hail ██████████████ a genius just off the back of his films Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, but this is stupid, the fact that Europa has gone un-noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema, whilst overrated rubbish like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Life is Beautiful clean up at the academy awards (but what do the know)
SarahBrown	validation	von Trier	Much like his first film The Element of Crime, █████████ uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world, and much like Element, the film begins with the main character (or in the case of Europa, we the audience) being hypnotized.
SarahBrown	testing	Max von Sydow	As we move down the tracks, the voice of the Narrator (█████████████) counts us down into a deep sleep, until we awake in Europa.
SarahBrown	training	von Trier	 The performances are good, they may not be on par with performances in later █████████ films, but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round.
SarahBrown	validation	Jean-Marc Barr	But I would like to point out the fantastic performance of ██████████████ in the lead role, whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides, until he erupts in the films final act.
SarahBrown	testing	von Trier	Europa is a tremendous film, and I cant help thinking what a shame that █████████ has abandoned this way of filming, since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time, Europa, much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes.
SarahBrown	training	Pasolini	Now I can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the Italian cinema (████████ etc.), by that time gone.
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Nicolai	Fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful █████████████ score.
SarahBrown	training	Oldboy	Having been first introduced to Park's work via ██████, I was curious to how he'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it.
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while ██████ and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vamp movies.
SarahBrown	testing	Tae-ju	Ah, but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen Father and his burgeoning lust for ██████ and conflict with duty as a priest.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	█████, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too.
SarahBrown	validation	Jabba	Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of █████'s court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster.
SarahBrown	testing	Luke	Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where ████ discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks.
SarahBrown	training	Warrick Davis	However, their leader, Wicket (played by █████████████) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.
SarahBrown	validation	George Lucas	"In 1997, ████████████ re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) ""Special Editions"", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements."
SarahBrown	testing	Jabba	"""Jedi Rocks"" musical number in █████'s Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film."
SarahBrown	training	Kenny Doughty	I think █████████████ looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable, but reasonable plot.
SarahBrown	validation	Doughty	McDowell's character, the headmistress, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist, filling in for the regular player (███████) catches her eye.
SarahBrown	training	Schneebaum	"I read ██████████'s book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of ""otherness"" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life."
SarahBrown	validation	Schneebaum	Even so, ██████████ himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	████ is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren't we all?
SarahBrown	training	Zentropa	████████ has much in common with The Third Man, another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar Europe.
SarahBrown	training	Kate	My wife, ████ and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!).
SarahBrown	training	Terrence Howard	The actor portraying the young ███████████████ character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town.
SarahBrown	training	Jackie Chan's	Unlike other Chinese action movies, which were always period pieces or (in the wake of █████████████ Police Story I) cop dramas, Pedicab Driver gives us a look at contemporary rural China.
SarahBrown	training	Erkia Christensen	Because wow what a performance by Busy Phillips and █████████████████ not to mention the rest of the cast!
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	When █████ is fed up with the way everything goes, he forms a gang with his brother and two other men.
SarahBrown	validation	Robin Hood	I guess nobody really knows, because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth: one camp says he was a hero, some kind of ██████████, the others will say he was an ordinary criminal, a murderer and a thief.
SarahBrown	training	Whoopi Goldberg	It is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially ███████████████ in her debut role.
SarahBrown	training	Cecil B. DeMille	"""The Plainsman"" represents the directorial prowess of ████████████████ at its most inaccurate and un-factual."
SarahBrown	validation	DeMille	Truly, this is the world according to ███████ - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.
SarahBrown	training	Gazzaras	"With various Bogdanoviches and ████████ scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is very much a family affair."
SarahBrown	validation	Louis Armstrong's	"The soundtrack to ""They all laughed"" varies from █████████████████ 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays."
SarahBrown	testing	Mr B	"████,s ""Golden Boy"" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be restored,and when that day comes ""They all laughed"" will be recognised for the fine work that it is."
SarahBrown	training	Jean Pierre Leaud	█████████████████ is amazing (more than usual) and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue.
SarahBrown	validation	Jean Eustache	█████████████ is no more on this earth, we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors.
SarahBrown	training	Chan-Wook	█████████ adds some much needed humour into the film, but this is only realised in the final third of the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Burton	" From the start, ██████ is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and ""dream time"" evaporates."
SarahBrown	validation	Burton	Water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to ██████'s discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps.
SarahBrown	testing	Burton	As ██████'s investigation continues, his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murder.
SarahBrown	training	Burton	"██████, becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel, says to his stepfather priest, ""Why didn't you tell me there were mysteries?"""
SarahBrown	validation	Burton	██████ knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves.
SarahBrown	training	Ed Hunt	"Writer/director ███████, the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey ""Starship Invasions,"" the uproariously inane Jesus Christ vigilante parable (!)"
SarahBrown	validation	Julie Brown	"And, yes, that's none other than ███████████, the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise Top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune ""The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun,"" as the lovely, vacuous, full-breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy, totally extraneous, yet still sizzling and much-appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song!"
SarahBrown	training	Vader	So those of you who are complaining that █████'s helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it.
SarahBrown	training	Bakula	██████ needs to find his niche--In QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything.
SarahBrown	training	Kiki	The chief threat to their love is ████'s brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him.
SarahBrown	validation	Kiki	"Ironically, ████'s love ""sickness"" isn't love for another woman, but her illicit, incestuous love for her brother."
SarahBrown	training	Gary Cooper	███████████ is at his most taciturn, but manages some occasional pithy sayings: 'The plains are big, but trails cross ... sometimes.'
SarahBrown	validation	Eisenhower	A remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what ██████████ was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex'.
SarahBrown	testing	DeMille	But let's not get into politics, let's leave that to ███████, who can be guaranteed to be superficial.
SarahBrown	training	George Antheil	The chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by ██████████████, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, 'Bad Boy of Music'.
SarahBrown	training	Walter Matthau's	Well this is a personal review, and my still living grandmother at age 97 (she even outlived ████████████████ magnificent impersonation of her!)would deny it -- but some of you must find resonance in these characters.
SarahBrown	validation	George Burns	Secondly, I have little tolerance for ████████████, but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances I can recall (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character).
SarahBrown	training	Devos	█████ is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard pops up for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	This is almost the definition of her role as █████, a put-upon office dogsbody, taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness.
SarahBrown	testing	Carla	Devos/Audiard manage █████'s deafness and its attendant, warped inner world with discreet, stylish flair.
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	Meanwhile, ██████, played by the also very gorgeous and talented Busy Phillips, is a nasty, cold-hearted, rebellious, anti-social goth girl who doesn't have a single positive trait on her... and she is unharmed when the shooting happens.. because it turns out, she was FRIENDS with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did... which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions..
SarahBrown	validation	Alicia	Of course she refuses this too, but the principal says that if ██████ doesn't do this, the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something.. and so she actually goes to see her...
SarahBrown	training	Leo Kessler	With so many cities lying in ruins, ███████████ a young American of German descent feels obliged to help in their restoration.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars Von Trier's	Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, I prefer ████████████████ later films (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots).
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Stewart	I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other is the one with ███████████████, but this is the better one!
SarahBrown	validation	Charles Dickens	 This movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by ███████████████, and I really think that you will agree, you will think that this movie is fabulous!
SarahBrown	training	Albert Finney	There is nothing to add, except that is a terrible shame that sir █████████████ still isn't accepted by the AMPAS (American Academy).
SarahBrown	training	Robert DeNiro	Except for one of the █████████████ scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	I don't like to tell people which movies they should see, but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that I thought was really worth seeing, then █████████ would be it.
SarahBrown	training	Oldboy	"Besides the apparent connections with ""██████"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action."
SarahBrown	validation	Stanley Kubrick	Park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to ███████████████; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Brosnan	The story is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the humor is hilarious I never thought that ██████████████ would be this funny, but he really is and I must say this movie is a must see.
SarahBrown	training	Georg Stanford Brown	Guest stars were killed off in the opening titles, one included ████████████████████ being crushed by a falling safe!
SarahBrown	training	Jean Pierre Leaud's	Watching ███████████████████ character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	"Rating ""10/10"" Master piece Some years ago, i heard █████████ comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance."
SarahBrown	training	Ms Hawn	A pretty average movie but a brave one from ███████ to promote this vehicle as Exec Producer & as a starring vehicle.
SarahBrown	validation	Goldie	██████ surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona & ventures in projects other won't.
SarahBrown	training	Mark Harmon	I have to admit though that ███████████ really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as Capano's and the behavior that Capano exhibited throughout this period.
SarahBrown	validation	Tom Carper	In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I have met ██████████ many times at various functions (a good man, despite being a politician) and I am so glad that he pulled the strings in the Federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime.
SarahBrown	training	Xica da Silva	Having grown up in the relative security of his house, the young and beautiful █████████████ finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town, refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter.
SarahBrown	validation	Xica	In a desperate bid to save herself, ████ steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king, intending to use them to escape.
SarahBrown	testing	Joao Fernandes	To the town of Tijuco, however, comes the new diamond commender, the elegant and ruthless ██████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Lena	All the while, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring ████'s life - her home life, her loves, her political views, her view of herself.
SarahBrown	validation	Sjöman	And placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, ██████, and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena.
SarahBrown	testing	Bjork	I am reminded of a █████ music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish.
SarahBrown	training	 Yellow	"While ""Jag är nyfiken ████████"" may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly intelligent, witty, refreshing, ebullient, and authentic."
SarahBrown	training	Jabba	█████ does not accept the negotiation,since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(Han still is frozen in carbonite)
SarahBrown	validation	Yoda	In his last moments, ████ asks to Luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to Luke transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people.
SarahBrown	testing	Luke	████ stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	He gives his last advice to ████ saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war.
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike's	███████████████ incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	█████ understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance.
SarahBrown	training	Alfred Junge's	No great coincidence: the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth films; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered, something best passed over in silence, when placed next to ██████████████ vision.
SarahBrown	validation	Powell	██████ dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it's the most natural thing in the world, a mere change of palettes.
SarahBrown	testing	Abraham Farlan	Consider the scene in which ██████████████ (Heaven's prosecuting lawyer) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match, and contemptuously says, `The voice of England, 1945.'
SarahBrown	training	Reeves	Dr. ██████ (the defence) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment, and then produces one of his own: a blues song from America, which Farlan listens to as though he's got a lemon in his mouth.
SarahBrown	validation	Powell	Well, I don't see why it's snobbish to condemn blues music - and that's not what ██████ and Pressburger are doing, anyway.
SarahBrown	testing	Reeves	All English audiences (and all Australian, Indian, etc. audiences as well) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast, too; and that while ██████ understands THAT, he is unable to explain it to Farlan - hence the blues broadcast, which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else.
SarahBrown	training	David Niven	I found ███████████ a bit cold, without the charisma he would acquire later in his career; but even so, I don't think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began, as this one did.
SarahBrown	training	e. g.	"""Crush"" examines female friendship, for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme (█████, ""Steel Magnolias"")."
SarahBrown	training	Jean-Pierre Léaud	you have a insecure, troubled and fascinating main character (played by █████████████████) who is trapped between two (no, three) women.
SarahBrown	validation	Jean-Pierre Léaud	being such a long movie, one cannot but burst into laughing when, after 2 hours of speaking politely, █████████████████ all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Françoise Lebrun	nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of ████████████████ towards the end of the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Davis	I've read a few negative comments in here about Hope █████ but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within.
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	There are lots of good chuckles as ███████ sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	I couldn't image ██████████████ in a serious role, but his performance truly exemplified his character.
SarahBrown	training	Michelle Pfeiffer	█████████████████ is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty.
SarahBrown	validation	Robert De Niro	██████████████ is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax.
SarahBrown	testing	Stardust	If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike, ████████ is the way to go.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	I know many true Star Wars fans hated ████████████ for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity.
SarahBrown	training	PO Fischer	The most far-fetched was when ██████████ (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room... that would never happen.
SarahBrown	training	Quato	This brief moment of mundanity is sharply broken as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is (it is quite possible that the sheer hideousness of the creature is some bizarre █████ homage).
SarahBrown	validation	Miyazaki	This really is a Miyazaki movie made into a live action movie, albeit a much seedier and more vicious than usual ████████ movie.
SarahBrown	testing	Kato	There is also limb severing, in one case a severed hand twitches in front of the camera dripping with blood, a fair amount of sexual energy (Agi wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with ████ as motivation, while the Princess of the Rivers wears next to nothing and gets her thighs groped by the young hero in several scenes), and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this technicolour wonder was seemingly designed for.
SarahBrown	training	Gozu	While it lacks some of the perverse charm of say ████ or Ichi it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	In fact this is easily █████'s most deranged movie in that he embraces the sheer magic of the subject so wholeheartedly.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Costner	The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last █████████████ movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld.
SarahBrown	validation	Ashton Kutcher	Plus, despite the promise ██████████████ showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.
SarahBrown	testing	Kenny Rogers'	The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than █████████████ orange face lift.
SarahBrown	training	George Clooney	Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make ██████████████ proud?
SarahBrown	validation	Costner	I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when ███████ started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Emily Watson	A chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Clark Gable	███████████ is a diamond-in-the rough, masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with Crawford's character.
SarahBrown	validation	Norma Shearer	"The same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite █████████████ in ""A Free Soul"", securing his position as top male sex symbol at MGM."
SarahBrown	testing	Crawford	"If you like ████████ in this type of role, don't miss ""Paid"", which she did a year earlier, which is also among her best early Talkie performances."
SarahBrown	training	Tarkovsky	All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union, and reason to conclude that █████████ is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinema.
SarahBrown	validation	Chekhov	"I was reading ███████'s ""Three Sisters"" the other day, and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film."
SarahBrown	testing	Veronika	"But the first letter of ████████'s name is not a further instance of this; in the Cyrillic alphabet, her name begins with a letter which looks like an English ""B""."
SarahBrown	training	Harry Potter	It's definitely up there in standards surpassing Bored of the Rings, and on par with movies like ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Rusty	The only problem I had is the idea that █████ has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves.
SarahBrown	validation	Jinx Falkenberg	When supermodel ███████████████, who plays herself in the film, speaks of getting married, she's warned by her boss not to, that she's too necessary to the modeling business.
SarahBrown	testing	Rita Hayworth	"Nevertheless, you can't beat ""Cover Girl"" for top entertainment, beautiful color, lovely music, great energy, fine performances, and its most fabulous asset, the glorious █████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Give it a try and you'll probably be as baffled as I am about how it could be so poorly treated on █████ night.
SarahBrown	training	Matthew	Of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw ███████'s name, and that made me get it!
SarahBrown	training	Miike	"But here █████, in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less, proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions, and with it boatload of CGI, creature-effects and make-up, and an epic battle that is more like a ""festival"" than something out of Lord of the Rings."
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	And through all of these comparisons, and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments, it's █████ all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters.
SarahBrown	testing	Miike	Soon, things come to a head, in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories, but can only be contained, up to a point, by █████ and his crew.
SarahBrown	training	Sato	This has creatures galore, including a one-eyed umbrella stand, and a walking, talking wall, not to mention a turtle, a fire serpent, and a woman who became cursed by ████.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	 Yet through all of this, the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of █████'s career is here as well, which distinguishes it from its animated, Muppet and sci-fi counterparts.
SarahBrown	testing	Akuzi	There's the bizarre humor as usual, including a song dedicated to █████ beans at a crucial moment in the climax, and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (I loved, for example, the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller, or the anxious turtle-Yokai).
SarahBrown	training	Miike	The biggest danger with █████'s access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry, which he flirts with, is overkill on this end.
SarahBrown	validation	Tadashi	He's got everything down, I'm sure, with storyboards, and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions (one of them is when all is said and done, and ███████ and the 'other' human character are in the middle of the Tokyo rubble in an overhead shot), but the CGI is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots, and the interplay skirts on being TOO flamboyant, and some visuals, like the overlay of the Yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map, just seem weak and pat.
SarahBrown	training	Alice Walker's	 Its an amazing book - but true to ██████████████ style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters - so I am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out.
SarahBrown	validation	Steven Spielberg	████████████████ thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of Africa outside of the Safaris -
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Stewart	But when I saw this movie on TV - as part of a commemorative █████████████ weekend upon his death - I finally GOT IT: I understood, at least in theory, what the Western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation (aside from just action and thrills).
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy Stewart	█████████████ plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the Alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold.
SarahBrown	testing	Walter Brennan	He is joined in this by his lifelong buddy, played by ██████████████ (perhaps the Western cliché character to end them all - but nevertheless enjoyable here, as always) - and no one else.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	"Pointedly, they are out for themselves, and while ███████ displays his patented charm (come on, we could never really dislike the guy, now could we?), we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self-centered, self-interested character: none of his ""Gosh"" or ""Oh golly gee"" humanism is allowed to come through."
SarahBrown	validation	Stewart	He comes on with so much charm and humor, and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with ███████, that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he *is* the bad guy - so that when it finally sinks in, it does so with double force.
SarahBrown	testing	Stewart	"Definitely one of the greatest performances I've seen from ███████, showing he could play the renegade, the ""man's man"" just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door."
SarahBrown	training	Sita	This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning ████ makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.
SarahBrown	validation	Sita	However, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about ████--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady.
SarahBrown	testing	Sita	In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way ████ could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	By the way, director ███████████ (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood.
SarahBrown	training	Emilio Miraglia's	"█████████████████ ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences."
SarahBrown	validation	Emilio Miraglia	"███████████████ isn't the most famous giallo-director, as he only made this one and the equally recommended ""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"", but his influence and importance should NOT be forgotten."
SarahBrown	training	Sammo	"The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and ""humor"" as in █████'s otherwise great Eastern Condors (1987), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with."
SarahBrown	validation	Max	"Still I think what Fennie says to ███ (about the future ""bad cooking"") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately."
SarahBrown	testing	Sammo	Pedicab Driver is among the most incredible Hong Kong action films that I have ever seen and easily among █████'s greatest achievements.
SarahBrown	training	Ebenezer Scrooge	I'm sure that most people already know the story-the miserly ████████████████ gets a visit from three spirits (the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways.
SarahBrown	validation	Dickens	███████' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite.
SarahBrown	testing	Alastair Sims	While I grew up watching the 1951 version starring █████████████, and I believe that he is the definitive Scrooge, I have been impressed with this version, which was released when I was in high school.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews	"█████████████ gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the ""Whistling in the Dark"" production number."
SarahBrown	training	Julian	Bond is a half-formed idea, a product of all that has gone before; while ██████ is a fully-formed character with his own motivations and flaws.
SarahBrown	validation	Danny	When he meets █████ in the hotel bar, he sees his opposite: a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems.
SarahBrown	testing	Danny	"He envies █████; the hit-man has become fed up with his life, sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable ""burn out"", as he puts it."
SarahBrown	training	Julian	One notable instance is when ██████ botches a job in Budapest because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope.
SarahBrown	training	Tess Nanavati	█████████████ is a relatively new directer and writer so I think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film.
SarahBrown	validation	Dominic	The acting (outside of ███████) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good.
SarahBrown	training	Ryan	"I don't know when or why the idea emerged in his head, but ████ wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie, ""Home room""."
SarahBrown	validation	Alicia	Busy Philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as ██████, a troubled girl; the ones we always see in television series.
SarahBrown	testing	Deanna	"""Many people"", ██████ answers; although some days later we learn they're from her parents, who come every week."
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	But after two days of visiting, she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day; even sleeping in ██████'s room all night.
SarahBrown	validation	Philipps	On the other hand, Busy ████████, who proved to be very promising in this movie (what a transformation), hasn't got many opportunities for other roles.
SarahBrown	testing	Paul F. Ryan	The same I say about ████████████ (in directing, of curse), and I expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script; I'm waiting for his next movie.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Landon Jr.	██████████████████ is an excellent director I look forward to many more movies from him in the future.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	█████ works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive, unappreciated and desperate.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and █████ is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week.
SarahBrown	testing	Paul	The colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, ████'s readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	He formulates a plan which utilises █████'s unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers.
SarahBrown	validation	Jacques Audiard	The fourth feature from director ███████████████, 'READ MY LIPS' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners.
SarahBrown	testing	Paul	The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of ████'s parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.
SarahBrown	training	Hayworth	████████ isn't even that much of a dancer, but she has a lot of 'inexperienced' charm that fits her character.
SarahBrown	training	Tadashi	"During a village festival ███████ is chosen the ""kirin rider"" or spiritual champion of the peace and justice."
SarahBrown	validation	Tadashi	It unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as ███████ struggles to find the strength to become a hero.
SarahBrown	testing	Miike	No one except █████ seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time, or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second
SarahBrown	training	Miike	I admire the fact that █████ has made a film that is bleak and hopeful, that doesn't shy away from being scary, I mean really scary, especially for kids.
SarahBrown	validation	Tadashi	One of the main characters is a Yokai which I think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal, it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on ███████'s head.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	You couldn't help but feel █████' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war.
SarahBrown	validation	Boris	█████' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would have to be.
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	"Make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees █████████████ but it is something to the effect of ""I don't think I like her!"""
SarahBrown	training	Harry Potter	The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, ████████████ and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office.
SarahBrown	validation	Neil Gaiman	Stardust, based on a novel by ███████████, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep.
SarahBrown	testing	Bourne	I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The ██████ Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see ████████, and I loved it.
SarahBrown	training	Brady	Quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of █████'s films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm.
SarahBrown	training	von Trier	In 50 years, when █████████ retires, he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet), and there will be classes taught in his name.
SarahBrown	validation	von Trier's	So the key to interpreting Europa, almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime, is that we are deep in our/███████████ subconscious, and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone.
SarahBrown	training	Manuel Tur	To his surprise, ██████████, one of his boyhood friends is also being treated, and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care.
SarahBrown	training	Jim	███, AKA Kid Wichita, has a way of making things happen, only trouble is, he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been.
SarahBrown	validation	John Barrymore Jr.	The opening credits state 'Introducing ██████████████████ as the Younger Brother', in this his very first screen appearance.
SarahBrown	testing	Jeff	That seemed rather odd to me, particularly since he was addressed as ████ almost immediately into the story.
SarahBrown	training	Drew Barrymore	No stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family, I was left wondering if his daughter ██████████████ might have ever seen this picture.
SarahBrown	validation	George Kerby	Knowing Sterling previously only from his role as ████████████ in the early 1950's TV series 'Topper', I thought he looked out of place in a Western, but that might just be me.
SarahBrown	training	Maurice Richard	It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture, to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed, and ate everything ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Acrobatty Bunny'	Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', '████████████████ is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty.
SarahBrown	validation	Acrobatty Bunny'	Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, '████████████████ is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at.
SarahBrown	testing	Acrobatty Bunny'	I've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but '████████████████ breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst McKimson's best.
SarahBrown	training	Jodie	"Where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy (""Little Darlings"", anyone?), █████ went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addiction."
SarahBrown	validation	Jodie Foster	But ████████████ continued to show her chops as a real adult actor (a trend started when she was very young in Taxi Driver).
SarahBrown	training	Sammo	A sequence in which █████'s pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone.
SarahBrown	validation	Billy Chow	The director/actor's assault on ██████████ and a house filled with angry, menacing opponents is a bone-cracking, physically punishing delight.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie Cox	███████████ (I had never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good leading man; he was so earnest and romantic, me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him.
SarahBrown	training	Ingmar Bergman	And those who've seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting ██████████████ and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it.
SarahBrown	training	David Boreanaz	██████████████, whom is the main reason I saw this movie, had a pretty small role, but he played it well.
SarahBrown	training	Jesse	"There is not much more I can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one, except - as █████ says - ""it's the berries""."
SarahBrown	validation	Robert Redford	Maybe ██████████████ did hold strict sway onto the actors/actresses during the filming of this movie, so that the beauty of the story would not get lost.
SarahBrown	testing	Tom Skeritt	This is the third film I've seen in which ███████████ (?) plays a father, all different styles and brilliantly acted.
SarahBrown	training	Nicole Kidman	"The third entry in the ""Stepford"" franchise, but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down, whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with █████████████ are commonly known and very popular."
SarahBrown	validation	Stepford	"The main difference here, like the title implies, is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective ""████████ treatment"", licensed by the local Men's Association."
SarahBrown	testing	Harding	The ███████ family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	I had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when I stumbled upon when I was searching for other films that stared ████████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Dom	I thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what his/her mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep,it was an interesting film and a good part was played by ███.......I believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere (well I've never seen it anywhere)
SarahBrown	training	Scott Bakula	████████████ played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	I wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the █████ saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge.
SarahBrown	validation	Gregor Jordan	█████████████ said in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here.
SarahBrown	training	Donna Summer	"Even the main song of the movie (""On the Radio"" by ████████████) was a big hit before this came out."
SarahBrown	validation	Scott Baio	Even ██████████ (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) more or less realistically played a teen boy.
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard's	Having written over five hundred reviews, I have never found myself at such a loss of words as I did with director █████████████████ subtle, yet inspirational love story.
SarahBrown	validation	Carla	As a viewer, you are pulled in instantly by Emmanuelle Devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named █████, whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty.
SarahBrown	testing	Devos	█████' solemn and homely look is breathtaking, as she changes her image for Paul; the truth of her beauty is discovered.
SarahBrown	training	Paul	████, the wildcard in the film, continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame.
SarahBrown	training	Saura	Seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of █████ are available on DVD in the USA.
SarahBrown	validation	Carmen	"I am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of ""██████,"" a spectacular work of art that is available in Europe but not here (European DVD's won't play on American DVD players)."
SarahBrown	training	Wook	If you have seen ████'s previous works/movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here.
SarahBrown	training	Odysseus	I was moved by the plight of ████████ and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which was felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals.
SarahBrown	validation	Homer	As in █████'s work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by classical statuary).
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy Smits	The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all kinds of people, played by some of the best actors in the business (I purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black, except for ███████████, of course)
SarahBrown	training	Pasolini	The clothing is linen, wool and fur, the settings stony and bare, everything is somewhat rugged and primitive, a bit what you would find in Cacoyannis or ████████ movies, and it makes it all the more authentic.
SarahBrown	validation	Penelope	He finally comes back to his homeland Ithaca after 20 years, and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse ████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Kirk Douglas	"The one by Camerini in 1955 starring ████████████ is a classic sword-and-sandal like ""the 10 Commandments"", but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story."
SarahBrown	training	Nero	"Once again, Bugs faces dumb opponent, one he calls ""████,"" but lion is fierce and Bugs will need all his wits and somewhat-fake bravado to fend off this beast."
SarahBrown	training	Marion	"They appear together in cheap comedies until ██████ is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic star."
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	What I love about this movie is █████████'s ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book.
SarahBrown	validation	Danny Glover	Furthermore, ████████████ was excellent as Mr. And usually, he's just himself throughout most of his movies.
SarahBrown	training	Terry Gilliam	Probably a bit much for normal American kids, and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film, this movie reminded me a quite a bit of Time Bandits - very █████████████ all the way through.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	And while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of █████'s work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn poignant.
SarahBrown	training	La Maman et la putain	Since my third or fourth viewing some time ago, I've abstained from █████████████████████ while I wait for the DVD.
SarahBrown	validation	Le Père Noël	The latter ends with a frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, doc, and in-between, impossible to see or, in the cases of Mes petites amoureuses and ████████████..., re-see.
SarahBrown	testing	Alexandre	█████████'s always choreographing himself, worrying about how or where to stand or walk, what to say when, announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does.
SarahBrown	training	Irma Vep	Isn't he still doing it, whatever it is, in recent roles, ████████, Le Pornographe, whatever, approaching old age?
SarahBrown	validation	Léaud	For a long while, every three or five minutes, down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf, tweedy coat, █████ hair, with a direction-seeking nose.
SarahBrown	training	Toni	In the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on- than ████ goes away...
SarahBrown	training	Villaronga	For this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and Director ██████████ is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense.
SarahBrown	training	Hayworth	I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always enamored of Ms. ████████'s looks, so I thought I'd give it a try.
SarahBrown	validation	Gilda	She's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of '█████', where she is sex symbol par excellence).
SarahBrown	training	Saura	I have seen a lot of █████ films and always found amazing the way he assembles music, dance, drama and great cinema in his movies.
SarahBrown	validation	Saura	The interest of █████ on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but █████ (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection.
SarahBrown	validation	Mehta	While developing her primary subject matter, █████ manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully.
SarahBrown	training	Wifes	You may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to The Stepford █████, but this is an absolute classic.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	Although ████████ seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it is certainly not.
SarahBrown	validation	Yvaine	We also know that the true love is ██████ and not Victoria , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative.
SarahBrown	testing	Stardust	The rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make ████████ an interesting and ''high classed'' movie Overall , the movie is FANTASTIC, the locations magical and the plot interesting.
SarahBrown	training	Andrews	"The opening song by Ms. ███████, ""Whistling Away the Dark,"" will always be in the back roads of my mind."
SarahBrown	training	Steven Spielberg	Not only is ████████████████ the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film.
SarahBrown	training	Tobias Wolff	The topics it addresses are ugly, cynical, and at times, even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, artful with its camera angles, and gorgeous in its style, skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories, ████████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Tom Noonan	This movie, of its own volition, has created in me the same feelings the main character (██████████) felt when words transformed his very existence, and that is one impressive feat.
SarahBrown	training	John McIntire	█████████████ is excellent as the law of Skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it.
SarahBrown	training	Rita Hayworth	Although a musical, I thought █████████████ did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well.
SarahBrown	training	David Niven	███████████ plays the RAF bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is AWOL and dispatches an angel to investigate.
SarahBrown	training	Jabba the Hutt	 The starting point of the movie was almost like Episode IV--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place, where the seriousness of mobster ██████████████ was getting even more serious.
SarahBrown	validation	Luke	He ordered ████ to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of Bantha, who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark.
SarahBrown	testing	Lando	Once it fired, the rebel fleet's only hope was that the Death Star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out, and this affected █████ so much because he wanted to destroy the Death Star
SarahBrown	training	Chewbacca	For instance, █████████, as well as another Ewok, was able to commandeer one of the walkers (and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers), and the other Ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers.
SarahBrown	training	Jeremy Sumpter	██████████████ does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	█████ has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Corman's	One of b- and c-movie producer ██████████████ greatest cult classics was the Ramones vehicle (originally designated for Cheap Trick), Rock N' Roll High School.
SarahBrown	validation	Napoleon Dynamite	It's just a simple, technically dated story (but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made █████████████████ characters funny--see Eaglebauer's van) about teenagers who love rock n' roll.
SarahBrown	testing	Togar	A Ramones fanatic, she has written some songs (including Rock N' Roll High School) that she wants to give to the Ramones, and in trying to do so, is rebuffed by Miss █████ who does all she can to keep her from going to see the Ramones play in town.
SarahBrown	training	Corey Feldman	I would recommend passing on the █████████████ vehicle, Rock N' Roll High School Forever, released nearly a decade later.
SarahBrown	training	Gloria Swanson	Rather than kidding her own image, as has been suggested here, to me it seems a satire on ██████████████, who did start off in slapstick comedies, went on to highly emotional women's pictures and did end up marrying a Count.
SarahBrown	validation	Gloria Swanson	Marion, a top mimic, also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand, that was ██████████████ spot on!!!
SarahBrown	testing	Peggy	█████ thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic.
SarahBrown	training	Peggy	It seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them - the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old █████ back.
SarahBrown	validation	William Haines	██████████████, another actor whose movies I had always wanted to see, was great - especially in the cafeteria scene , he had wonderful comic timing.
SarahBrown	training	Gialli	With ██████ and Gothic Tales being my two favorite sub-genres in Horror, I was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while, and even though my expectations were high, this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes.
SarahBrown	validation	Barbara Bouchet	"An incredibly mesmerizing Giallo with strong Gothic elements, ""The Red Queen"" delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre: An inventive and incredibly compelling plot, spine-chilling suspense, a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere, eerily lush colors, stylish murders, a brilliant score, and, not least, a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful ███████████████ - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror."
SarahBrown	testing	Miraglia	"Director ████████ had already proved his incredible talent for style, atmosphere and colorful creepiness with ""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"" and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem."
SarahBrown	training	Grandfather	The haunting painting in the ███████████'s castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps.
SarahBrown	validation	Barbara Bouchet	The ravishing ███████████████ (one of my favorite actresses) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen, and she is a great actress too.
SarahBrown	testing	Bruno Nicolai's	███████████████ mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets, and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting.
SarahBrown	training	Gialli	"""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest ██████ ever made, and a top-priority for every fan of Horror and/or Italian cinema to see."
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	"The only other 2 Ghost Stories to even come close was the ORIGINAL "" The Haunting "" and ███████████████ in "" The Changling "" ."
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	"Sadly, no memorable quotes here, but this one's my favorite: █████████: If you're leaving someone that you have loved, you have to say what I'm telling you now: ""Farewell, I'm going."""
SarahBrown	validation	Alexandre	There is so much tactics involved in the relationships between █████████ and the others, and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth.
SarahBrown	training	Gundam	"The first ""side-story"" in the universal century ██████ universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies."
SarahBrown	validation	Alfred	██████ is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool.
SarahBrown	testing	Gundam	"Each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an OVA and are sure to satisfy the craving for some ""mandatory"" mobile suit battles in a ██████ series."
SarahBrown	training	Alfred	Not only do the characters, whom all except ██████ are caucasian, sound more believable in English but the performances of the English voice cast are on par and even surpass the Japanese one, instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action TV dramas.
SarahBrown	training	David	While defending the Aborigines, █████ learns the last wave theory, and begins to wonder whether it's just mythology.
SarahBrown	validation	David Gulpilil	"Aboriginal actor ██████████████ (whom you may have seen in ""Walkabout"", ""Crocodile Dundee"" and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"") provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants."
SarahBrown	training	Courtney	This film has its detractors, and ████████'s fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant.
SarahBrown	validation	Courtney	I thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads, and ████████'s character provides plenty of dark humor.
SarahBrown	training	Robert DeNiro	From there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, █████████████ as a gay pirate.
SarahBrown	validation	DeNiro	it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching ██████'s own opening up into alternate forms of acting).
SarahBrown	testing	Stardust	████████ is the type of movie, perhaps, that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time.
SarahBrown	training	Ricardo	Also, though I figure this was due to budgetary constraints, the ███████'s are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in New York, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucy	 There's also Desi talking about buying RKO in 1953, during ████'s red-scare incident, even though RKO did not hit the market until 1957.
SarahBrown	testing	Asher	"These changes well could have been for dramatic license, and the film does work at conveying the main facts, but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to Oppenheimer and █████, two vital figures in ""I Love Lucy"" history?"
SarahBrown	training	Lucy	The film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about ████'s life, since much is skimmed over or omitted at all.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Simon	This makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film, perhaps the best ██████████ ever wrote.
SarahBrown	validation	Willy	"The amazing thing about ""The Sunshine Boys"" is how much it rubs your noses in █████'s almost existential condition without turning you off at all."
SarahBrown	testing	Willy	"""89 years old and just like that, he dies of nothing'"" █████ says of one old songwriting friend, before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed ""lady"" with ""baby""."
SarahBrown	training	Lewis	His lines kill you, too, especially when he's trying to kill █████, for whom the TV reunion turns out to be a bad idea.
SarahBrown	validation	Herbert Ross	Director ████████████ shoots everything in a very casual and understated way, with low lighting and mid-range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance.
SarahBrown	testing	Ross	"You never get the feeling you are watching a movie, one of ""The Sunshine Boys"" many charms, and ████'s direction, like the acting of the three principals, goes a long way toward achieving that end."
SarahBrown	training	Martin Luther King	But Sjoman does something interesting: the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes; it's impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative, documentary, film-within-a-film, and even a serious interview with ██████████████████, who also acts as a quasi-guru for Lena.
SarahBrown	validation	Bergman	Where ███████ had it down to a T with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies, Sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors.
SarahBrown	training	P.J. Soles	"It's amazing that actress ██████████ didn't become a big star after playing Riff Randall, #1 fan of the punk rock group the Ramones, in ""Rock 'n' Roll High School""."
SarahBrown	validation	Paul McCartney	"One Ramones song, ""I Want You Around"", is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good, particularly a rare ██████████████ ballad heard near the beginning (""Did We Meet Somewhere Before?"")."
SarahBrown	training	David Niven	Beautifully shot and acted, although ███████████ doesn't seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be.
SarahBrown	training	John Wayne's	The best film on the battle of San Antonio, Texas in March 1836, was ████████████ 1960 epic THE ALAMO.
SarahBrown	validation	Wayne	In a one shot job as director producer, that temporarily financially strapped him, █████ demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon-like acting ability personifying the West.
SarahBrown	testing	Ruben Padilla	The role was played by an obscure actor, █████████████ (on this board, his thread shows only three credits listed).
SarahBrown	training	Benito Juarez	No political figure or military figure would rise to override him until █████████████ did in the late 1850s.
SarahBrown	validation	Fannin	His massacre of Col. ██████'s men at Goliad was inexcusable (one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the Alamo who were fighting to the last, but Fannin had surrendered).
SarahBrown	testing	Franklin Pierce's	"He would be President for the last time in 1853, in time to give █████████████████ horrendously bad administration it's one moment of glory - Santa Anna sold the border of Arizona and New Mexico (the ""Gadsden Purchase"") to the U.S."
SarahBrown	training	Santa Anna	 Julia's ██████████ is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became America's best land purchase agent.
SarahBrown	validation	David Ogden Stiers	Most of the time his chief aide, Col. Black (██████████████████, here a British born officer) holds his tongue - he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be.
SarahBrown	testing	Santa Anna	At the end, when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead Alamo defenders, Stiers suggests that they tell the world what ██████████ is really like.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	Visually stunning and full of Eastern Philosophy, this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director █████████, the man behind some of the best films Hong Kong cinema has produced.
SarahBrown	training	Runner	"He plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films like ""The Green Mile"", ""Indian ██████"", ""The Negotiator"" or ""The Langoliers"" he plays a very sympathetic person, and in ""Bait"" the plays almost the opposite, a man without any emotions, which was nice to see."
SarahBrown	training	Davies	"Well, ██████ then gets a job at a more prestigious studio (""High Art Studios"") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces."
SarahBrown	validation	Andre Telefair	A handsome but fake actor (██████████████) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star.
SarahBrown	testing	Marion Davies	"█████████████ is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a ""serious"" actress."
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	"I just saw ""█████████"" and I have to say that it was the best slasher movie that I've seen in years."
SarahBrown	training	Jack Cardiff	"""A Matter of Life and Death"" has a brilliant cinematography by ████████████, a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera."
SarahBrown	training	Odysseus	Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, e.g. the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes ████████ in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece,not some Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B-flick.
SarahBrown	training	t.v.	I'm surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this ████ movie...as far as I'm aware, the series itself, has had a huge following, reviewer pundits and real people alike, have praised it to a person.
SarahBrown	validation	Tennison	"This abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama - it's very skilfully dealt with, in less than a couple of minutes screentime, a marvel of economy in scripting, and editing - but it's always there, as a counterpoint to ████████'s desperate efforts to find another ""lost child"" - a kidnap victim - before it's too late."
SarahBrown	testing	Tennison	The story takes many twists and turns,before the surprise ending, and one is fascinated, alike, by the plot, and characters (although I found the many villains a little overdrawn), the police, and especially ████████, herself, are not always competent, nor that likeable, which figures, given the unpleasant job that they have to do, in the sleazy underworld which this series, habitually inhabits.
SarahBrown	training	Mirren	"██████, herself, has said that she'll make no more movies in the series, but, excellent as she's always been in the role of Tennison, the series, itself, is as ""actor proof"" as is another addiction of mine"
SarahBrown	training	Bernard Malamud's	It totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of █████████████████ fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American.
SarahBrown	validation	Emily Watson's	 Pure love, as personified by ██████████████ Natalia, can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously.
SarahBrown	training	Bugs Bunny's	When the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over ████████████ home, Bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid.
SarahBrown	training	Emilio Miraglia's	█████████████████ first Giallo feature, The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave, was a great combination of Giallo and Gothic horror - and this second film is even better!
SarahBrown	validation	Evelyn	It's obvious that the colour red is important to him, as it features heavily in both films; and he appears to have something against women called '██████'.
SarahBrown	testing	Barbara Bouchet	The female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning ███████████████ and Marina Malfatti heading up an eye-pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off!
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Nicolai	The score courtesy of █████████████ is catchy, and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave; it fits the film well.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Roddenberry	Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks, and I believe ████████████████ would surely be proud.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Capano	he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator; in this case, portraying attorney (and murderer) ██████████.
SarahBrown	validation	Rachel Ward	We are sorry for the situation, but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women (including ███████████) as well.
SarahBrown	testing	Ann Rule's	All in all, an interesting story because it is based on a true murder, and you will want to read ██████████ book to get the accurate details.
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	In fact, the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller, and only lawyer ███████████ has the answer.
SarahBrown	validation	Chamberlain	███████████ underplays throughout, especially during the underground discovery tour where I think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does.
SarahBrown	training	Pat Boone	Once you get over the image of squeaky clean █████████, as a supposedly bad boy, you'll have no trouble with the rest of the film.
SarahBrown	validation	Nick	In the early going, he is unreachable and cold, but as he slowly warms up to ████, we see that he's really a pretty good guy.
SarahBrown	testing	Andy Griffith	Think of it as the old █████████████ show with musical numbers, a little more plot, and wide screen Technicolor.
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy	It was when █████ gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.
SarahBrown	validation	Fred	It was almost by accident that ████ ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front.
SarahBrown	testing	Jimmy	Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, █████ had become a top mobster in New York City's underworld!
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy	"█████'s life of crime came full circle when Rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a ""Valentine Day"" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters."
SarahBrown	validation	Jimmy	While on trial █████ came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together.
SarahBrown	testing	Jimmy	But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for █████!
SarahBrown	training	Jimmy	It was then that █████ decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn't have the heart to do, for him!
SarahBrown	training	Kim	Many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability, especially the young woman (played by OK-vin ███) who becomes the object of the priest's love, lust and affection.
SarahBrown	validation	Poe	"Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular) and also fans of ███'s ""The Tell-tale Heart"" (watch and learn) should lap this up, it's yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainment."
SarahBrown	training	Paul F. Ryan	Like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one-man show as ████████████ was both the writer and the director.
SarahBrown	validation	Ryan	████ takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance.
SarahBrown	testing	Sarah McLaughlin's	"Why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song (██████████████████ ""Sweet Surrender"") he goes out on, and the amazing editing of the final minute."
SarahBrown	training	Christensen	Although Phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and ███████████ her intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before.
SarahBrown	validation	Alicia	What is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie ██████ to the lone shooter.
SarahBrown	testing	Ryan	A story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ████ could have easily steered this film into cliché and predictability.
SarahBrown	training	Picasso	It is said, that even ███████ was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years!
SarahBrown	training	Julie	A real curiosity item in that it was the last major film █████ did for about 10 years and, in many ways, is a precursor to Victor/Victoria.
SarahBrown	training	Charles Dickens	A rather morbid tale one might think, but it is classic ███████████████, and also one of the most famous and popular Christmas stories of all time.
SarahBrown	validation	Dickens	To me this is the definitive version of ███████' timeless story; it's the one I always remember watching in school, and I remember being absolutely terrified by it!
SarahBrown	testing	Jacob Marley	The ghost of ████████████, the final scene with the ghost of Christmas present under the bridge, and the ghost of Christmas yet-to-come especially I found very frightening.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	Most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text - that of the ghost of Christmas present showing ███████ the two children hidden under his robe (you'd never get away with a scene like that nowadays!).
SarahBrown	validation	Snowman	Perfect holiday season viewing; coupled with copies of It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street and The ███████ and you've got everything you need.
SarahBrown	training	YouTube	If you look it up on ███████, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third viewing).
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	█████████ is getting away with life perfectly, being totally taken care of, getting and giving what he wants.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	These are two men, each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of ██████ to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear.
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	And ██████ lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.
SarahBrown	testing	Finney	██████, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor.
SarahBrown	training	Courtenay	And █████████ is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer.
SarahBrown	validation	Norman	For although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and ██████ act like nothing so much as an old married couple.
SarahBrown	testing	Madge	There is a wonderful scene where Sir and █████ talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.
SarahBrown	training	Steven Spielberg	The fact is, ████████████████, probably our greatest story-teller, has been doing this in various movie formats for years.
SarahBrown	validation	Spielberg	In hindsight, this film should have come as no surprise, for █████████ had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in E.T. Critics called COLOR PURPLE his entrance into intellectual fare.
SarahBrown	testing	Alice Walker	No special effects, no swashbuckling, just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Spielberg	One surprise is how █████████ could present such a moving film about African-Americans in the deep south.
SarahBrown	validation	Spielberg	 █████████ is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience.
SarahBrown	training	Leopold	███████ soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption, being taken advantage of, losing his ideology, and is forced to chose between pest or colera.
SarahBrown	validation	Lars von Trier's	These are some immediate, grandiose, descriptions that come to mind when thinking of ████████████████ 1991 masterpiece EUROPA; the final chapter of the Europa trilogy.
SarahBrown	testing	Agnieszka Holland's	In USA it was retitled ZENTROPA so audiences wouldn't confuse it with ███████████████████ EUROPA EUROPA from 1990 (equally a WWII drama).
SarahBrown	training	Andrei Tarkovsky	EUROPA utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style -- that famous Russian director ████████████████ is Trier's main-influence says it all.
SarahBrown	validation	Steven Spielberg	According to rumors this inspired ████████████████ to use the similar effect in SHINDLER'S LIST from 1993 (coincidentially another WWII drama).
SarahBrown	testing	Stanley Kubrick's	EUROPA is often criticized for weighing advanced technique (such as multi-layered background-projection) above plot and characters, but hey that's what reviewers criticized █████████████████ 1968 visual masterpiece 2001:
SarahBrown	training	Trier	According to various online-sources that's correct (a fascinating subject - try Googl'ing it yourself!), yet █████'s purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately.
SarahBrown	validation	Leopold Kessler	███████████████ is hypnotized, therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality.
SarahBrown	testing	Trier	It's right up there with other █████ classics and semi-classics such as FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT from 1984, the TV-series RIGET from 1993 and DOGVILLE from 2003.
SarahBrown	training	Pat Barker's	"Adaptation of ████████████ novel ""Union Street"" (a better title!) is so laid-back it verges on bland, and the film's editing is a mess, but it's still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy."
SarahBrown	training	Colin Geddes	████████████, the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in Japan.
SarahBrown	validation	Takashi Miike	"After the screening I can understand where they were going with that, but damn this is ""█████████████"" after all."
SarahBrown	training	Alecia	Meanwhile the police are investigating ██████ as she might have known the shooting was going to happen.
SarahBrown	training	Will Smith	"Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring ██████████."
SarahBrown	training	Brad Sykes	Zombie Chronicles isn't something to shout about, it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining B-movie directed by ██████████ who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick.
SarahBrown	validation	gore	The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining, the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget, the ████ is also great and gross, the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre █████████'s Day cards.
SarahBrown	validation	Valentine	However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for █████████.
SarahBrown	testing	Valentine	It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for █████████'s extravagant lampooning.
SarahBrown	training	Dylan Sellers	"Lest some think I'm ""reading too much"" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he ""didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend"" and producer █████████████ said he wanted to do something ""more adult""."
SarahBrown	training	Sooraj R. Barjatya	In that sense ██████████████████ has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Salman Khan	He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than ███████████ when it comes to acting in a Sooraj R. Barjatya film.
SarahBrown	testing	Sooraj R. Barjatya	The movie has top-notch performances, excellent story and great music to suit the film, as well as being directed by the fabulous ██████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Hitchcock	In my opinion █████████ has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some (cheap) thrillers, but on the other hand I must admit that I was intrigued by it because this is a European movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Hitchcock	Normally it's the big Hollywood studios who like to abuse █████████'s name if that can raise their income.
SarahBrown	testing	Carla	"""Sur mes lèvres"" or ""Read my Lips"" as it is called in English, tells the story of a young secretary named █████."
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and █████ the typically helpless woman, but thanks to their performances, you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together.
SarahBrown	training	Stardust	Highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, ████████ tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful.
SarahBrown	validation	Neil Gaiman	But the real power in the film is the novel by ███████████ and the script made from his creative and fertile mind.
SarahBrown	training	RAYMOND MASSEY	My only minor quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful ██████████████ is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene.
SarahBrown	validation	Technicolor	The ███████████ photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is excellent and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness.
SarahBrown	training	Jeanie	██████ and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand.
SarahBrown	training	Anne DeSalvo	I've always knew ████████████ was a great character actor, now I know she is a great writer/director also.
SarahBrown	training	Will Smith	"Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring ██████████."
SarahBrown	training	Stalin	 During the war, ██████ used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting, introducing female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic, suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic, then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers.
SarahBrown	validation	Sergei Uresevsky	 This film featured brilliant, breathtaking, and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer ████████████████, using spectacular crane and tracking shots, images of wartime, battlefields, Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real.
SarahBrown	training	Gundam	The story takes place during the same time line as the original ██████ in the year U.C. 0079 the time of the One year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate.
SarahBrown	validation	Shiro Amada	The Hero of the story is a young Lt. ███████████, who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.
SarahBrown	testing	Aina Sahalin	His life get complicated when he meets ████████████ a Jion ace pilot (the enemy), the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them.
SarahBrown	training	Anavel Gato	Right up there with Char Aznable and ███████████ is Norris Packard, not the top villain in this series, but his presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight.
SarahBrown	training	Fritz Feld	"There's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film, and character actor ██████████ starts it all off with a ""pop."""
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into █████'s lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.
SarahBrown	training	Charlie Chaplin	You get to see (briefly) some of the major stars of the day; even ███████████████ does a turn as himself, seeking an autograph.
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	Their father is Reverend ███████ and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion, and the lessons of fly-fishing.
SarahBrown	training	Bill Hicks	Since a remake is apparently in the works, it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar, half-funny dick jokes, as ██████████ used to call them.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff	She takes an instant liking to ████ in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to Skagway, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder.
SarahBrown	validation	John McIntire(as Sheriff Gannon	███████████████████████████████) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying.
SarahBrown	testing	Soapy Smith	He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous ███████████, who spent his last years in Skagway, as one of the premier con men of his times.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff	In this respect, he differs from Lancaster's character, who never reforms(But is ████ truly changed, or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?)
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	She dies as a result and ████ asks her why she didn't just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!).
SarahBrown	testing	Jeff	Yet, the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together, even though ████ never visibly gives her a kiss or hug.
SarahBrown	training	Rhonda	Her image as a good, if naive, young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in ██████'s saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust, pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later.
SarahBrown	validation	Jeff	And how did ████'s badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease?
SarahBrown	training	Sally Potter	"But unlike ""Yes"", by ████████████, which I had seen some days before, where after leaving the cinema I felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive, this time quite the opposite thing happened: there was something that dragged me down, and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe."
SarahBrown	validation	Nina	████'s life seemed to be dismal and locked, but then, one lovely day, there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams.
SarahBrown	testing	Nina	████ could be that child, after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity.
SarahBrown	training	Nina	And ████ adopts that idea, after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion, she also longs for a mother.
SarahBrown	validation	Toni	But in the end she is empty-handed, ████ has disappeared with a man, and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman.
SarahBrown	testing	Nina	Therefore, in the end, we see ████ all alone, about to walk along the road that has opened up before her, into a future that seems joyless and uncertain.
SarahBrown	training	Geraldine	They fall in love,to the horror of her social-mountaineering mother (█████████ James).A wonderful love story, whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral.
SarahBrown	validation	Nabakov	But in spite of its origins in a ███████ story, it certainly is not .The romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands down.
SarahBrown	training	Scott Bakula	"Without that annoying ""PRIME DIRECTIVE"" floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool.. and ████████████ was without a doubt a GREAT CHOICE for Captain, and the Vulcan Babe is hot too, (Check out the decontamination scene)I gave this a FULL 10... it blows away ALL the other series openers.."
SarahBrown	training	Lamhey	After watching DDLJ, Saajan, and ██████, I really thought that Bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that - EVER.
SarahBrown	validation	Shahid Kapor	After all everyone who has seen ████████████ know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor.
SarahBrown	testing	Sonali	(yes people I will challenge you find even 0.1% fat on her and unlike so many others like ██████ she can actually act too).
SarahBrown	training	Freud	"It's a reverie, sorts of - so apt enough there are a lot of motives, █████ might have found interesting for his dream analysis, like all the ""doppelganger""-constellations."
SarahBrown	validation	Gespenster	"To describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphaned mother, who searches Europe for her lost daughter, clearly doesn't say much about the nature of ""██████████"" at all."
SarahBrown	training	Schindler	"I can't believe I am just now seeing this film -- I think perhaps I thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated, and I avoided Roots for the same reason -- just as I have yet to see █████████'s List -- I don't want to be ""entertained"" by other peoples' pain, not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be."
SarahBrown	training	Patrick Galloway	It tells the story of ████████████████ an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in Ireland to investigate some weird phainomena.
SarahBrown	validation	Covenant	Mostly the game revolves around the ████████ estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress.
SarahBrown	testing	Clyve Barker	Thanks to the talent of ████████████ the game has an excelent storyline and plot (something very rare for a First person shooter) and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier's	███████████ follow-ups like Breaking the Waves have gotten more acclaim, but this is really his best work.
SarahBrown	training	Hugh Grant	About time some one made a good young British comedy that didn't star ██████████ or forty something's.
SarahBrown	validation	Luke Goss's	███████████ cameo was surprisingly very good, but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'.
SarahBrown	training	Baio	████'s skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass, and we are meant to get through them, to better times.
SarahBrown	training	Pitt	The dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see ████ here makes the film so worth watching.
SarahBrown	training	Julian	"Although the sardonic ██████ (ironically surnamed ""Noble"") appears to be a ""tough guy"" on the surface, underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities, a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless."
SarahBrown	validation	Brosnan	Playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being, ███████ is flip and cavalier one moment, then genuine and sympathetic the next.
SarahBrown	testing	Richard Shephard	This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director ████████████████, and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	"'The Matador"" is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will, hopefully, signal a new phase in ███████'s acting career."
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir's	████████████ first international success, THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth.
SarahBrown	validation	Richard Chamberlain	███████████████████ gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries.
SarahBrown	training	Bakula	As the captain always leads the show, ██████ adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins.
SarahBrown	validation	Akira	So why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships, namely the █████ class starship?
SarahBrown	testing	Rick [Berman	Continuity has been an issue in Enterprise, but thankfully ████████████] and Brannon [Braga] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	When ████████████ destroyed the Star Wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy, fans couldn't do anything, only watch and sap it all up anyway.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	When it comes to creating a universe ████████████ is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga).
SarahBrown	validation	Anakin Skywalker	The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what ████████████████ went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor.
SarahBrown	testing	Ian McDiarmid	█████████████ appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever.
SarahBrown	training	Lucas	In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always █████' forté so that is really to be expected.
SarahBrown	validation	Lucas	It was also a nice touch that █████ decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax.
SarahBrown	testing	George Lucas'	Also █████████████ stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.
SarahBrown	training	Park Chan-Wook	██████████████ throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of.
SarahBrown	validation	Park	Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective ████ seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across.
SarahBrown	training	Ranikhet Almora	Thankfully this time all Indian locales like ███████████████ etc have been used, which have been already visited by most of the urbanites, hence adding to the connection with movie.
SarahBrown	validation	Suraj	I want to express on candid thing here that though █████ proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals, his approach is totally individualistic.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Andrews'	██████████████ belting out of war songs and the haunting 'Whistling Away the Dark' are reason enough to turn the TV on, just for the soundtrack.
SarahBrown	training	Amrita	This movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that ██████ had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn't a rich business tycoons daughter or anything.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	Given that both movies are made by the legendary █████████, the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in Hong Kong has changed over two decades.
SarahBrown	training	David	As █████ pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	Just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy German bombardment, or the death of █████ with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies.
SarahBrown	training	Citizen Kane	It's a classic that really does rank right up there with Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, Gone With the Wind, ████████████, & Chariots of Fire.
SarahBrown	validation	Fantasia	There IS hope -- 1940's ████████ wasn't a hit 'til the '60s, & the Wizard of Oz was a dud at the box office, but made a hit by TV.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ███ looked at!
SarahBrown	training	Miike	Even the worst █████ is better than a good many films, though, and The Great Yokai War has a lot in it that's worth recommending.
SarahBrown	validation	Miike	I might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it (the DVD includes an English dub), but, like all of █████'s films, it can tend to move very slowly.
SarahBrown	testing	Miike	The story itself isn't very good, either, and █████'s perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head.
SarahBrown	training	Agi	I especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), ███, who sports dark eye shadow, a tight, white outfit, a white beehive hairdo and a whip.
SarahBrown	validation	Ryunosuke Kamiki	The hero of the film is played by ████████████████, who provided voices for Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
SarahBrown	training	Polly Walker	The movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the scenery is beautiful (as is ████████████), and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying.
SarahBrown	training	Anakin Skywalker	It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, ████████████████, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).
SarahBrown	validation	Han Solo	In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always ████████).
SarahBrown	testing	Yoda	They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in ████'s home.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas's	"I don't get the appeal of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Trek"" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of ██████████████ films."
SarahBrown	validation	Anakin Skywalker	Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of ████████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Bailey	"In ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ██████ gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born."
SarahBrown	validation	Webster	By not getting involved (and by attempting not to care about anyone), ███████ is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt, pushed around, and even killed while he stands by and does nothing.
SarahBrown	testing	George Bailey	This reminds the viewer of █████████████ watching a world that has turned upside-down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	"███████, by turning around his philosophy of non-involvement, has, it would seem, earned his ""wings""."
SarahBrown	training	Gregg Giuffria	Keyboardist ██████████████ remains the bands highlight, and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut, ever!
SarahBrown	training	Robert De Niro	"██████████████ is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide ""in the closet"" to protect his ""reputation""!"
SarahBrown	validation	Stardust	████████ makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	Clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by ███████ and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way.
SarahBrown	training	Betsy	In a coonskin cap and carrying Ol' █████, he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie.
SarahBrown	training	Mike Newell	Under the brush stroke direction of ███████████, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye.
SarahBrown	training	Stephanie Beecham	The movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from █████████████████ and everyone is perfectly cast.
SarahBrown	training	James Eves	██████████ has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action, fall and then rise to a climax.
SarahBrown	training	Marlene Gorris	██████████████ could perhaps have examined the psyche of Luzhin, rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	I have seen this movie a while back, after ordering it for my friend, who is a big ████████████████ fan.
SarahBrown	training	Donnie Darko	"The movie itself was very interesting, though it had its positive points, which for me was the ████████████ kind of ""wtf?"" factor after the movie had ended."
SarahBrown	training	Tess	With all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill, ████ shows that it's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors.
SarahBrown	training	Chan-wook Park	Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director ██████████████ is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire.
SarahBrown	training	darby	note - during the live ramones set, notice that █████ crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd.
SarahBrown	training	Trey Parker	"I think the only solution here is to create puppet-driven animation (like for example ""team America"" by ███████████) or even computer 3d animation."
SarahBrown	training	Marlene Deitrich	The brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while ████████████████ sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this refrain.
SarahBrown	training	Alun Armstrong	And even obsessive ██████████████ is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and keep taking the medication!
SarahBrown	training	Drebin	"Finally, the show takes certain risks that the films avoid; in the first episode, ██████, to ""re-enact the crime"", has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles - ballistics the hard way."
SarahBrown	training	Oldboy	"The vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with, how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of ""Sympathy For Mr Vengeance"" with the frantic and extravagance of ""██████""?"
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	Just what has ███████ tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves?
SarahBrown	training	Norman	As the movie opens, ██████ is an old man, flyfishing beside a rushing river, trying to understand the course his own life has taken.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	██████ is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life, even as his father grills him about what he intends to do.
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	But with all the beauty and contemplation, and even though the Macleans are truly a God-fearing, scripture-heeding household, how is it that Rev. ███████'s family is unraveling?
SarahBrown	training	Paul	████ is true perfection as he fishes the river, but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing, while his family doesn't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed.
SarahBrown	training	Dad	Mom, ███ and Brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	Director ██████████████ plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting, and it works well.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	You'll see ██████ made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest -- and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it, leading into the unknown.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	However, this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely & entertaining story, quite faithful generally to ███████' novel.
SarahBrown	training	Marley	 ██████'s anguished ghost (with his wonderful jaw dropping scene) and the three Spirits are all quite convincing.
SarahBrown	training	Tiny Tim	Above all, this version has unquestionably the best ████████, not only an adorable & endearing little waif but sickly.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	 █████ is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	Worse, if someone like █████ has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire).
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	In any case █████'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny.
SarahBrown	training	Adolph Hitler	If you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a RAF Lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of May 1945 is somewhat unlikely since German air defences were as lively as █████████████ on that day but this isn't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience
SarahBrown	training	Richar Attenborough's	When █████████████████████ young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didn't survive the war .
SarahBrown	training	Peter Carter	it's obvious Nazis don't go to heaven  The plot itself where dashing young pilot ████████████ arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext , you see A MATTER OR LIFE AND DEATH is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the British empire as it's replaced by American ambitions .
SarahBrown	training	Sergei Urusevsky's	██████████████████ camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	█████████ once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world.
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	Of course the Dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some welcome spotlight on █████████).
SarahBrown	training	Von Trier	The story is typical for █████████: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relations with everybody else, but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves.
SarahBrown	training	Kate	"I have seen her in ""Kiss Me, ████"" and ""Victor/Victoria,"" as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations."
SarahBrown	training	Lucy	After all, those of us who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what ████ was really like in her early movie years.
SarahBrown	training	Rachel	I believe that ██████ deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon.
SarahBrown	training	Craig Sheffer's	The dramatic irony was there so ███████████████ character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death, knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film.
SarahBrown	training	Eaves	It was a great step up from █████' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production.
SarahBrown	training	Hickory Dickory Dock	However, I loved how ████████████████████ was filmed, it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant ABC Murders, and it really set the atmosphere, what with the dark camera work and dark lighting.
SarahBrown	training	Poirot	The darker moments were somewhat creepy, this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a ██████ adaptation, maybe not as disturbing as the one in One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares.
SarahBrown	training	Leslie Nielsen	██████████████ is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You ain't seen nothing yet.
SarahBrown	training	Brian Krause's	Although the camera work is lacking, ██████████████ character is annoying, and the plot is clique, it's much more funnier than the first and that is what I find entertaining about it.
SarahBrown	training	Amelie	As in ██████, recent French films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant, centered on a female finding her one true love.
SarahBrown	training	Iris	`Stanley and ████' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life.
SarahBrown	training	Iris	After Stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in Chicago, only to return to ████ and ask her to marry him.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier Movie	"This is the definite ████████████████████, my favorite, I rank it higher than ""Breaking the waves"" or the latest ""Dancer in the Dark""..."
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	Does ███████████, who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines, die in the last wave?
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	Taken as a film, this one is pretty good, and it's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director, ██████████, and the Australian film industry.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	"We have videos of many of ███████ s movies and we have watched ""A River runs through it"" many times."
SarahBrown	training	Maclean	The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. ███████'s father.
SarahBrown	training	Norman	I love the scene where ██████ and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer!
SarahBrown	training	Brad Pitt	"Then as adult Paul played by █████████ (Se7ven) is the ""perfect guy"" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it."
SarahBrown	training	Neal Burns	The same applies to ██████████, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects, to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as ███████ because I have had the chance to see his works.
SarahBrown	training	Lars Von Trier	Someone release this movie on DVD so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the so-called films of the 1990's and see how vapid they were for the most part, and how ██████████████ tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Turturro	Suffice to say that ████████ is magnificent as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and Em matches him step for step as the strong-minded woman who is drawn to him.
SarahBrown	training	Robert De Niro	██████████████ is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	But once again, the story by ███████████, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply outstanding.
SarahBrown	training	Jeff	This movie has a lot to do with ████....it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in Girls.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	"My introduction to Ms. ██████ was a ""clip"" from this film; the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions."
SarahBrown	training	Haines	My introduction to Mr. ██████ was in viewing this film, presently; though, it's possible I've seen him in a less memorable role.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	The story starts off with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) driving daughter ██████ into Hollywood, certain she will become Tinseltown's newest sensation.
SarahBrown	training	Tom O'Horgan	Luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, ████████████ (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway).
SarahBrown	training	howard hughes	on one hand, they are veritable geniuses, and on the other, painfully self-destructive (it's a lot like people like █████████████
SarahBrown	training	norman maclean	for ██████████████, a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur, and who was to blame.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	███████ melts into this character so well, that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	"I know; it is not perfect, but under the title ""The Americanization of Lily"" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special █████ Edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative."
SarahBrown	training	Uncle Kurt	"The logical end of the film comes when after the terrible WWI has ended, as she sings the theme song of the film, ""Wishing"" in a darkened theater, one by one the members of Larrabee's squadron appear, including her lover himself, indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even ██████████ enthusiastically joins in the singing of ""It's a Long To Tipperraree"", to indicate all is well with the world again."
SarahBrown	training	Edwards	It is hard to say enough nice things about the pace, or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by ███████ to leaven the horrors of actual warfare, to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization..
SarahBrown	training	Lili	This comedy also helps prepare the way for ████'s conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing.
SarahBrown	training	Blake	"I consider it to be █████ Edwards'masterpiece of directing; and under the title ""The Americanization of Lili"" I believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard I know."
SarahBrown	training	Scott Bartlett	After viewing it, it slightly wasn't was I was expecting it to be (it tended to be a more organic-looking film, not that that's a bad thing, but I was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering the techniques ██████████████ used to make the film, including hand-tinting the film itself, and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes (filmed off of a video monitor), giving it a more distressed, lo-res look.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	 I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the ███████████ novel which I am now looking to read) and colorful characters.
SarahBrown	training	David	█████ want's to know if it's all aborigine folklore or there's some scientific facts, or logic, behind their end of world-like revelations.
SarahBrown	training	David	 The stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that █████'s been seeing in both his night-time dreams and day-time visions.
SarahBrown	training	Willie	"First Al had little habits, such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter ""t"", and slightly jabbing ██████ with his index finger, on stage."
SarahBrown	training	Ben	███ is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about American Comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Willie	He does bring Al to see ██████, and the sparks begin flying, as neither can figure out what the other is doing (and this is just in rehearsal.
SarahBrown	training	Willie	"On top of that, ██████ is insisting on changes (minor ones, but they throw off Al) such as saying ""ENTER!!!"""
SarahBrown	training	Benjamin	████████ strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle, although Matthau's rough outer shell makes it difficult (he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville).
SarahBrown	training	Burns	Matthau has a little better grasp on reality (at first) than █████, who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality Matthau's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly.
SarahBrown	training	Burns	"█████ (whose last involvement in any film was in THE SOLID GOLD CADILLAC in 1956 as the narrator) turned in such a fine performance that he got the ""Oscar"" for best supporting actor, and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as OH GOD!;"
SarahBrown	training	Gracie Allan	He died in 1996 age 100, having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife ████████████.
SarahBrown	training	David Kelly	The only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by ███████████).
SarahBrown	training	Ben Barnes	One day a young man from Wall named ██████████ out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech.
SarahBrown	training	Stormhold	He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called █████████ where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una.
SarahBrown	training	Robert DeNiro	 But Tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother (though he doesn't know it's his mother) and a band of flying pirates led by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Matthew Vaughn	"Moreover director ██████████████, whose only other directing experience was ""Layer Cake"", weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy."
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	This motion picture has a steady, haunting pace backed up with great acting (one of ███████████'s best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time.
SarahBrown	training	Weir	████'s story is enhanced by using aboriginals, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous.
SarahBrown	training	Ursula Le Guin's	"Although they are unrelated in story as well as genre, this maintained the same feeling within me as ████████████████ ""Lathe of Heaven"" (1980)."
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier's	Then I read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and I have to say, I know it probably wouldn't be true to ████████████████ vision, but I would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned!
SarahBrown	training	Yoda	The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot  By the way, if you enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and ████, then you should read a few books about Buddhism and the forms it took in Ancient Japan.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	People have skulls thicker than ███'s helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	█████████ has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of Australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	So not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical █████ gang, I actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie.
SarahBrown	training	Lighthorseman	It was sentimental and romantic, but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow Australians, watch 'The █████████████' and you will see what I mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly).
SarahBrown	training	Ned	Ironically, I actually enjoyed the movie because of that, because it would be those details that most of the focus on ███'s story would dwell.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	This movie was always going to have a hard time, having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to Australians; perhaps a little of ███'s spirit is in this movie, because I think it rebelled against people's expectations, and unfortunately missed both targets.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	I just recently watched this 1954 movie starring █████████████ for the first time on Turner Classic Movies.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	Her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with █████.
SarahBrown	training	Gene	████ choreographed the dance sequences (he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here), and his 'Alter Ego' dance number is amazing.
SarahBrown	training	Gene	However, I was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with ████ and Rita.
SarahBrown	training	Stephanie Beacham	With excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the Hammer Horror scream queen herself █████████████████, this really is fantastic stuff.
SarahBrown	training	James Eaves	Despite it's low budget, by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality CG effects to the mix, director ███████████ has created something that feels much bigger.
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	He could portray the sour and crusty Scrooge, and a misunderstood, sympathetic ███████ all in the same scene.
SarahBrown	training	Welles	I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent in which devious Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several ██████ movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does.
SarahBrown	training	von Trier	After Zentropa, █████████ moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary, over-rated, un-nuanced sap like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
SarahBrown	training	Helen Mirren	Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child' has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these British dramas but of course the beautiful ████████████ easily dominates; our eyes never leave her while she's on-screen.
SarahBrown	training	Jane Tennison's	The search for the lost child of the title leads Superintendent ███████████████ CID team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters.
SarahBrown	training	Kalatozov	(For anyone interested in film technique another movie by █████████, I AM CUBA, has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana, rises two stories to a cigar factory, tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long, long avenue - all without a cut.)
SarahBrown	training	Dracula	"""bakjwi"" literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see count ███████ or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva."
SarahBrown	training	aesop	Duality of human nature = if you ever read █████'s fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	The story of █████████ has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	What ensures █████████ has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	The more the stories try to portray █████ as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.
SarahBrown	training	a Ned Kelly	Rather than attempting to portray ███████████ who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	Here, █████████ is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	While the █████ gang were distinctly Irish, Australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this).
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	If one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that █████████ becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at Glenrowan.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	Annoyingly, the trial and execution of █████████ is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	That said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, █████████ manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning.
SarahBrown	training	Maurice Richard	A boy who adores ███████████████ of the Montreal Canadiens receives, much to his horror, a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the mail.
SarahBrown	training	Maurice Richard	I recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey, but nearly everyone knew about ███████████████ and the Toronto/Montreal rivalry.
SarahBrown	training	Cooper	Indeed its Quinns character who informs ██████ of the massacre of Custer told in flash back, the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the American west with American history.
SarahBrown	training	Ruben Santiago-Hudson	Based upon the experiences of writer-actor █████████████████████, the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s.
SarahBrown	training	S. Epatha Merkerson	As delivered by actress ███████████████████, that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger temper is frozen in his tracks.
SarahBrown	training	Merkerson	 From start to finish, █████████ delivers a commanding presence Her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home.
SarahBrown	training	Agustí Villaronga	"Like his earlier film, ""In a Glass Cage"", █████████████████ achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor."
SarahBrown	training	Aaron Sheritt's	Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only ███████████████ efforts alone, that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery.
SarahBrown	training	Alexandre	"Now to the film, what I say will contain ""spoilers"" and if you don't mind, here goes:  █████████ is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo."
SarahBrown	training	Alex	Gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because ████ had abused and battered her.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	At this point, ████ was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out Gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else.
SarahBrown	training	Alex	Veronika fell in love with ████ for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past.
SarahBrown	training	Brian Froud	Picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the Goblin Mountain where he discovers the Yokai, who are amazing creations that ███████████ would be proud of.
SarahBrown	training	Takashi	███████ a young boy is the one to become their saviour, alongside a red man/dragon a turtle man and a River Princess as well as a cute little creature that, if it had been America they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores.
SarahBrown	training	Amadeus	All the folks who sit here and say that this movie's weak link is the Ramones would probably say that ███████ was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist.
SarahBrown	training	T'pol	"It stumbles a few times into ""Trek"" convention and cliché--candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style, and I can already foresee snickering references to █████ as ""Seven of Vulcan""--but"
SarahBrown	training	Scott Bakula	████████████ hits the right note as a captain with Kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players.
SarahBrown	training	George Clooney	The rest of the actors are also good and if you're a ██████████████ fan, you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie.
SarahBrown	training	Julie Brown	Also, ███████████, the great actress, singer, comedienne and gay icon, gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked.
SarahBrown	training	Julie	█████ is 'absolutely fabulous':P So basically, this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s.
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	And I feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Tristan	The main character, ███████ (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie.
SarahBrown	training	Gamera	"A few of the funny references I liked were the comment about ██████, the scene that came with the comment ""KIDS: Don't Try This At Home"" as well as the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the Yokai (hmm,...perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning)!"
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike	" By the way, director █████████████ is a hard one to pin down stylistically, other than to say that none of his stories I've seen have seemed ""normal""."
SarahBrown	training	Hunter-Niven	Anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie's offhand references - anyone interested in romance will be moved by ████████████, and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworld.
SarahBrown	training	Foxx	Believable and amazingly likeable, ████ glides through the movie, smooth as butter and funnier than hell.
SarahBrown	training	Marius Goring	This other place, like a heaven, is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world, so they send French Conductor 71 (█████████████) to persuade him to go, but he is obviously in love.
SarahBrown	training	Peter	█████ suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world's court, he is granted this.
SarahBrown	training	David Niven	███████████ was number 36 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, it was number 47 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 46 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and it was number 59 on The 100 Greatest Films.
SarahBrown	training	Lelouch	THE CRANES ARE FLYING is, for the first half at least, supremely entertaining, boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin; a fresh, brisk, spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms; two stunning subjective set-pieces; and a romantic verve that flirts with, but never quite topples into, ███████ territory.
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	He promises to write to ████████, but never does, thinking maybe she hasn't bothered to see him off, or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable.
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	████████, disgusted with herself and an adulterous Mark, refuses to believe this, and awaits his return, fostering a young orphan bearing his name.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than █████'s perceived indifference.
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	 When Mark tries to force himself on ████████, the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations.
SarahBrown	training	Veronika	One more grasp for Expressionist overload - ████████'s attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant - is clumsily handled; and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film.
SarahBrown	training	Lucille Ball	"(I believe that ████████████ may have modeled her later career on Davies' style, that could be termed ""zany beauty"".)"
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Brosnan	So, ██████████████, the Irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-smoking, sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis.
SarahBrown	training	Greg Kinnear	He meets a struggling businessman, ████████████, and after a rocky beginning, he learns that he needs a friend.
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike	"""Yokai Daisenso"" is a children's film by █████████████, but as you might expect, it's probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones."
SarahBrown	training	Gamera	"One quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city...says one, ""Oh, it's only ██████""."
SarahBrown	training	Yokai	 The young boy has befriended █████, which are monsters of a kind, mostly benign, that have isolated themselves away from humans, and all the Yokai in Japan band together to fight the evil.
SarahBrown	training	Julian	Despite their completely different personalities and ██████'s crude and insensible remarks, they become friends.
SarahBrown	training	Johnny	It had the same style of humour as 'Airplane!'; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities, and recurring characters such as ██████ the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything.
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	As the movie goes along it's like ███████ only cares about himself just like his character in the Naked Spur.
SarahBrown	training	Citizen Kane	A perfect blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made: ████████████, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind.
SarahBrown	training	Yubari	You name it, it's there: a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy/dysfunctional world into another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; a beautiful heroine he has a crush on; a sadistic henchwoman (Go-Go ██████ from Kill Bill Vol. 1); a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to.
SarahBrown	training	Emannuelle Devos	████████████████ gives a truly stunning , multi-faceted performance, at times devious and manipulative, at other times open and vulnerable.
SarahBrown	training	Andie	Beauty is all around, in actors' play (█████ is superb as always), in well designed shots, and in authors' red line idea - the Love.
SarahBrown	training	Kenny	I think the █████'s character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life.
SarahBrown	training	Andie	The fact that █████ successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad, instead it shows that life prevails in any forms, even in this small British village, which is shown perfectly.
SarahBrown	training	Amrita Rao	██████████ quit different even though I felt that someway the other to me she doesn't suit in that role.
SarahBrown	training	Melle Mel	The movie has old school features such as Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster █████████ & the Furious Five, the Rock Steady Crew, the New York City Breakers, and many more....
SarahBrown	training	Scrooge	Yes, there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit ███████, but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a couple of mistakes.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	"In as selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose ourselves in ""The Christmas Carol"", starring ███████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Marion Davies	█████████████ should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role.
SarahBrown	training	Kim	███ in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep.
SarahBrown	training	Clinton	That is the reason the Feds became involved, he called ███████ and asked him to get the Feds involved in the case.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier's	████████████████ Europa is a worthy echo of The Third Man, about an American coming to post-World War II Europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery.
SarahBrown	training	Leopold	The colonel soon enlists, or forces, ███████ to be a spy (without giving him a choice or chance to think about it) to see if the Werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains.
SarahBrown	training	Leopold	Soon, ███████ is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir-ish way, where everyone and everything is not what it seems.
SarahBrown	training	Leopold	Its amazing to watch the naive ███████ deal with everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, annoying passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even the railway company's officials who come to examine his work ethic) before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control.
SarahBrown	training	Max von Sydow's	Add ███████████████ hypnotic narration, and Europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	I have seen the trailer for this movie several times over, and I have to say that █████████ looks like it is going to be a wonderful film.
SarahBrown	training	Mace Windu	I reckon That made the movie ending a little bit interesting But the Producers or anyone should off made a spirit off Padme And ██████████ And Other Jedis that got killed with Younglings Under There Arms in the back ground
SarahBrown	training	Takashi Miike	█████████████ uses the fantasy genre, particularly, the children's fantasy genre, as a springboard into the wild territory that is the Great Yokai War.
SarahBrown	training	Pokemon	This ending, with it's Yokai spirit who is the spitting image of ███████'s Pikachu, warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves, but of the horrors of over-consumption.
SarahBrown	training	Miike	This is one of the first scripts █████ has contributed to, and I believe it shows, as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness.
SarahBrown	training	Miyazaki	There's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film, and the ████████ comparisons are warranted, as are the NeverEnding Story and Labrynth comparisons, though this film is sharper and more adult than either.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	This is essentially a variation on House Of Wax ,in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies ,█████████████.
SarahBrown	training	the Great Rinaldo	this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist ,█████████████████ (John Emery)insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designs.
SarahBrown	training	Rinaldi	He deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon ███████ and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer.
SarahBrown	training	Price	The rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on █████ who carries the burden with ease .
SarahBrown	training	gore	Good solid B Movie melodrama , this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece .Shot in black and white it is low on ████ and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	The setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of ███████' classic tale.
SarahBrown	training	Dickens	The 19th Century English town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to ███████ and adds to the plausibility of this film.
SarahBrown	training	Sanchez	While drinking puke isn't really my thing, as far as a substantial entertainment show goes, Dirty ███████ is way out of Jackass's league.
SarahBrown	training	Cloris Leachman	And of course ███████████████ (also in this film) in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years..
SarahBrown	training	Emilio P. Miraglia	"Directed by ██████████████████ who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting ""La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba"" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences."
SarahBrown	training	Sette Volte	"A convincing Giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings, ""La Dama Rossa Uccide ███████████"" is highly recommended to Giallo fans and slightly superior to Miraglia's above mentioned other thriller."
SarahBrown	training	Neil Simon's	Also, be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate ████████████ brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Benjamin	About ████████████████: I personally find his acting annoying in general, and his work in this movie is no exception -- although he has some fine moments here.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	Hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for █████'s club, but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter.
SarahBrown	training	Rita	Too bad ████ didn't sing her own songs (well, she may have a couple of them, as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes).
SarahBrown	training	Singin	I do think ██████' in the Rain is the better film, as Cover Girl is a little rough around the edges.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	Sick of the current cinema output, particularly American cinema, I've been making an effort to see the █████-winning foreign films.
SarahBrown	training	Tatyana Samojlova	Why █████████████████ as the young woman didn't become an international star after this is beyond me(though she has remained successful in her own country).
SarahBrown	training	Tatyana	And the beauty of it (like when ███████'s character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence).
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	The great █████████████ has done many fantastic Horror films, some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all-time.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	As the lines above may suggest, █████████████ is my favorite actor, and, while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in, none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem.
SarahBrown	training	Rihanna	It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella (███████ eat your heart out!)
SarahBrown	training	Iris	████ discovers that Stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen.
SarahBrown	training	Robert DeNiro	However, █████████████ is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect.
SarahBrown	training	Ramon	"The only major fight scene in ""Beat Street"" was when graffiti artist █████ (which in the movie was abbreviated as ""Ramo"") is chased by a rival gang member on the New York City subway tracks.....fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail."
SarahBrown	training	Neil Gaiman	As a massive fan of fantasy in general, and of the works of ███████████ *in particular*, I've been looking forward to this film so avidly, so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can scarcely believe it's finally here.
SarahBrown	training	Brennan	It's ███████'s death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the process.
SarahBrown	training	John McIntire	█████████████ is the head villain of the piece and he was an under-appreciated actor with a vast range.
SarahBrown	training	Bouchet	Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent ███████ as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life.
SarahBrown	training	Red Queen	In fact, all the visuals are interesting with the laughing █████████ running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film.
SarahBrown	training	Gialli	If you've seen more than a couple ██████, you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings.
SarahBrown	training	Chan-wook Park's	Although I've never seen the film, I couldn't help but feel like this was ████████████████ version of Twilight.
SarahBrown	training	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it.
SarahBrown	training	Oscar	1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' █████ is little more that a hood ornament for good party members.
SarahBrown	training	Scryeeee	"It's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which I usually don't care much for), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround soundeffects (""████████, scryeeee.."") and above all incredible atmosphere."
SarahBrown	training	Scrye	I love the █████, which enables you, at certain places in the games, to see or hear events that happened there in the past.
SarahBrown	training	Clive Barker's	I'm a great horror fan, escpecially of ██████████████ stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story.
SarahBrown	training	Janice Meredith	In fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy, she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	 What you're seeing by all accounts in Show People is the real ██████, a gifted comedienne, a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person.
SarahBrown	training	Marion	██████ is eager young hopeful who arrives in Hollywood like so many others, looking for that big break.
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	 What I don't see is why everyone has such a problem with ██████'s choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene, from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice.
SarahBrown	training	Tobias Schneebaum	This film follows anthropologist █████████████████, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to West Papua and then Peru.
SarahBrown	training	Asmat	Author of several books documenting his time with both the █████ people of West Papua and the cannibalistic Amazonians in Peru, Tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become.
SarahBrown	training	Vladimir Nabokov	This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by ████████████████ and captures well that writer's dark irony.
SarahBrown	training	Alyssa Milano	It's a wonderful, adventurous storyline, and █████████████ is wonderful at playing the wholesome, confident, no-nonsense Fizzy...a great role-model.
SarahBrown	training	Porky	And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (█████'s, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the movie holds up well against time.
SarahBrown	training	Sally Kellerman	It's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line (███████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Susan Sarandon	██████████████ is such a good actor, that she made an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing.
SarahBrown	training	John Kassir	This time there are Christmas themed opening & closing Crypt Keeper (███████████) segments complete with the usual puns.
SarahBrown	training	Zemeckis	Director ████████ does a good job & there's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of Christmas influence as well.
SarahBrown	training	gore	There's not much ████ here, someone has a poker stuck in their head, someone's face is cut with an icicle, someone's arm is cut with an axe & there's some blood splatter but generally speaking it's not that graphic.
SarahBrown	training	Denise Richards	███████████████ on the DVD extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters.
SarahBrown	training	gore	The direction is very good, managing to show very little actual ████, and relying on your imaginations implied threat.
SarahBrown	training	Richards	"Much can be said also for the similar manner in which Miss ████████ and Heigel do not remove their clothes...:-( Essentially, the main directorial plus, lies within the ""borrowing"" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks."
SarahBrown	training	Latecomer	"(█████████ that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary ""Patti Smith: Dream of Life"" sometime around 2040!)"
SarahBrown	training	baker	Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, and that band dishes out a █████'s dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total blast.
SarahBrown	training	John Ford's	"A good film with--for its time--an intense, sprawling, rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of ███████████ ""The Searchers"" though not so brutal."
SarahBrown	training	Stewart	The story starts fast and doesn't let up, with several scenes of really good dialog between (███████'s)
SarahBrown	training	Mann-Stewart	"This film is in some ways reminiscent of ""Bend of the River"" (1952), also a ████████████ work, but I found it far less sentimental and more interesting."
SarahBrown	training	Corrine Calvert	There are a few caveats: a too-quickly wrapped up (and rather sentimental) ending; 24-year-old ███████████████ is not very convincing as a naive French teenager, and of course the film takes place in the Mythic West, a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics don't apply.
SarahBrown	training	James Stewart	█████████████ is surprisingly good as a dark, disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself, and the mountain scenery can't be beat.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price's	"Even though it has one of the standard ""Revenge Price Plots,"" this film is my favorite of ███████████████ work."
SarahBrown	training	Kang-ho Song	████████████ stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly, mysterious virus.
SarahBrown	training	Curt von Bardeleben	In this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called ███████████████████ who committed suicide in 1924.
SarahBrown	training	Achilles	So Luzhin is a genius with an ████████ heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament.
SarahBrown	training	Valentinov	"	██████████ is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him."
SarahBrown	training	Gorris	"	To tell Luzhin's story, ██████ effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess."
SarahBrown	training	Luzhin	And as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who ██████ is and how he got to this point in his life.
SarahBrown	training	Gorris	For the scenes of his childhood, ██████ textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort.
SarahBrown	training	Gorris	The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace ██████ sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well.
SarahBrown	training	John Turturro	The single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Emily Watson	"	As Natalia, ████████████ is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely."
SarahBrown	training	Watson	Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin, ██████ manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective.
SarahBrown	training	Countess	In the beginning, I like how she resembles the ████████ (from Zu Warriors) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life.
SarahBrown	training	Gorris	Maybe this is because ██████' takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation.
SarahBrown	training	Nabokov	The final consequence is a point of view over Luzhin which dignifies him more than the ███████'s one.
SarahBrown	training	Luzhini	One aspect I liked especially is the idea of the antagonist--███████'s (Turturro's)--ex-mentor working his evil on the sidelines.
SarahBrown	training	Jeremy Sumpter	██████████████ is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today, and he is perfectly cast as the young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictional New York Empires (great name!).
SarahBrown	training	Emilio Miraglio's	"█████████████████ ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that I have ever seen, mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed."
SarahBrown	training	Bruno Nicolai	Another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy, hummable score, and █████████████ provides one for this film that should stay with you for days.
SarahBrown	training	Ugo Pagliai	Well, I'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings, shootings, impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out...not to mention the crypts, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and LOTS of 'em, too!), the drug references, a rape scene, the obligatory red herrings and, in the person of ███████████, a hunky leading man for the female viewers.
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier	██████████████ shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension.
SarahBrown	training	Hitchcock	Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like █████████ and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene.
SarahBrown	training	Tsui Hark	I've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 (both done by █████████), and the 2001 is far better in comparison IMO.
SarahBrown	training	Heath Ledger	One of my favourite films from the late legend ████████████, who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in.
SarahBrown	training	Bourn	#2-The █████ Ultimatum, which I have seen, awesome movie but 3rd week out, average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say).
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Mann	Much like other ████████████ pictures, The Far Country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery.
SarahBrown	training	Mann	Both of which play out amongst some of ████'s peccadilloes like honour, integrity, betrayal and of course, death!
SarahBrown	training	William H. Daniels	"The cinematography from ██████████████████ is superlative, tho not done any favours by current DVD prints, and the film has a few surprises and a ""will he wont he?"" core reeling the viewers in."
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	Some aspects of the film are fictional, and as an avid █████████ fan (and supporter), was slightly disappointed by this.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	Perhaps also the film could've gone longer, to cover more of the █████ Gang's/Ned's life - I felt not enough was covered.
SarahBrown	training	Robert Redford	I have seen all the films directed by ██████████████ and appreciated his love of the American people and the land.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	What makes these relationships special however, is the attention ███████ gives to the language as spoken in dialogue.
SarahBrown	training	Redford	While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in ███████'s directorial hands.
SarahBrown	training	Max	"When ███ commits suicide, Leopold is also pressed by the ""Werewolves"" and need to take a position and a decision."
SarahBrown	training	Lars von Trier	"""Europa"" is an impressive and anguishing Kafkanian story of the great Danish director ██████████████."
SarahBrown	training	Fritz Lang	Using an expressionist style that recalls ██████████ and alternating a magnificent black & white cinematography with some colored details, this movie discloses a difficult period of Germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war.
SarahBrown	training	Max	Very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country, and the corruption with the Jew that should identify ███.
SarahBrown	training	Jean-Marc Barr	██████████████ has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody.
SarahBrown	training	Agusti Villaronga	The latest film by the Spanish director █████████████████ is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community, develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty.
SarahBrown	training	Pedro Almodovar's	The cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the Spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow Spaniard █████████████████ work with themes dealing with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual.
SarahBrown	training	Mary Woronov	"Portraying a bunch of high school students using the Ramones' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal (████████████, of ""Eating Raoul"" fame), the whole movie is a mile a minute."
SarahBrown	training	Madge	and then she is telling █████ how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations I had personally had.
SarahBrown	training	Dave Morse	I was impressed with the supporting actors and of course ██████████ always puts in a terrific acting job.
SarahBrown	training	Jodie Foster	"This, however, does not apply to our ""known"" actors in this film, notably ████████████ (born a natural)."
SarahBrown	training	Jodie	The fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the story--█████ plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close, even with the obvious feeling of fatality.
SarahBrown	training	Kate	Pal ████ Rambeau(Dey Young, whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide her stunning beauty)joins forces with Riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good which is Togar's desired mission.
SarahBrown	training	Clint Howard	"████████████ steals the film almost(honestly, who can steal this film away from Soles?)as Eaglebauer, ""the supplier"" who can get everyone almost anything."
SarahBrown	training	Paul Bartel	███████████ is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff's when he enjoys a concert of THE RAMONES.
SarahBrown	training	John Turtorro	█████████████ doesn't really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic chess player, not to speak of the Italian player.
SarahBrown	training	Dominic Monaghan	I loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer...the acting was top notch - honestly, I would watch ████████████████ read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great as well.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Pierre Leaud's	Watching ███████████████████ character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends.
SarahBrown	training	Oprah	The only name I didn't see was █████'s ,thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a Hallmark movie.
SarahBrown	training	Pauline	It was moving but not phony, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, ███████ and the writer in question.
SarahBrown	training	Bill Crosby	The movie revolved around the universe of Nanny, Mrs ███████████ and how she raised the writer and took in people.
SarahBrown	training	Lou Gosset	But no she explains to ██████████ she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price's	"Basically the exact same movie as ""House of Wax"" - ███████████████ first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares, because ""The Mad Magician"" offers just as many sheer thrills, delightful period set-pieces, joyous 3-D effects, sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor!"
SarahBrown	training	Don Gallico	"███████████ is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as Gallico the Great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled ""The Girl and the Buzz Saw""."
SarahBrown	training	Ross Ormond	Gallico's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ███████████ appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose, stating that all of Gallico's inventions are the rightful property of the company.
SarahBrown	training	Alice Prentiss	"""The Mad Magician"" is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view, as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of ██████████████ is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era."
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	Needless to state that █████████████ remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film, as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price	█████████████ simply was a genius actor and, in my humble opinion, the embodiment of the horror genre.
SarahBrown	training	Blockbuster	Just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time, picked it up one night previously viewed at ███████████ and absolutely loved it, I've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well.
SarahBrown	training	Paul F. Ryan	"Avoid of all the Hollywood glamour, special effects and stress on the ""shock factor"", this independent film by ████████████ hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations."
SarahBrown	training	Dawn Marie Wellesley	"Overall, I recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it, I also suggest the documentary ""It's a Girls World"" put out by CBC in 2004, which deals with the topic of social bullying, comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of ████████████████████ a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied."
SarahBrown	training	Kern	The music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it's so perfectly styled in the early 20th Century idiom that was ████'s original period.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	"Probably the most memorable performance in the film is █████'s dance to the ""Alter-Ego Dance"", which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience."
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	Fans will want to seek this out for various reasons -- █████ fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of MGM with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his usual MGM material.
SarahBrown	training	John Williams	My surprise was great when I discovered the score to have been written by none other than █████████████ himself.
SarahBrown	training	Williams	But in my opinion what ████████ has written for this movie surpasses anything I've ever heard of his for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie.
SarahBrown	training	Cecil B. DeMille	"After the failure of ""The Crusades"" at the box office, ████████████████ stopped doing films about non-American history."
SarahBrown	training	Maximillian	It was Reconstruction that occupied his attention, not the west (except for the problems of ███████████ and his French controlled forces in Mexico against Juarez).
SarahBrown	training	John Pope	"In 1862 he sent disgraced General █████████, the loser at Second Manassas, to Minnesota to put down a serious Indian war by the Sioux (the subject of McKinley Kantor's novel, ""Sprit Lake""."
SarahBrown	training	Cooper	"However, with all Lincoln's actual attention to western problems, it is doubtful that he says (as ██████ repeats at least once), ""The frontier should be secure."""
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	I was impressed with ███████████, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness.
SarahBrown	training	Shabana Azmi	But I was even more impressed with ████████████, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.
SarahBrown	training	Hawn	████ is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians.
SarahBrown	training	Randy Quaid	I can't believe this only has a 5.9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion, and it was funny seeing ███████████ in this type of role, plus this is extremely well written and made as well!.
SarahBrown	training	Kagan	One scene that really got to me was when Madge(Marilyn █████), is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party, and the film has many surprising moments as well!, plus the dialog is especially excellent.
SarahBrown	training	Adrian Lyne	███████████ does a fantastic job here, with awesome camera work, and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace!.
SarahBrown	training	Cherie Currie	█████████████ is way hot, and is amazing here, i really felt sorry for her character, as she had a very likable character that just needed help, she gives a powerful performance, and created a very memorable character she was amazing!.
SarahBrown	training	McCoy	Fortunately for us Real █████ fans (most likely all Baby Boomers who grew-up in the late 50's and 60's), three of the adult actors/actress appeared when they did for the reunion show, in 2000.
SarahBrown	training	Grandpa	I remember, as a child, mimicking ███████'s gimp walk and my parents laughing (as I'm sure a million other children did back then).
SarahBrown	training	Tony Martinez	In fact, although █████████████ seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak-out and say too much during the Reunion show.
SarahBrown	training	Goldie Hawn	"""Protocol"" is a hit-and-miss picture starring ███████████ as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting Arab from an assassination attempt."
SarahBrown	training	Hawn	"████ is excellent as usual even though ""Protocol"" isn't as funny as her best film ""Private Benjamin""."
SarahBrown	training	Celie	This is the story of a young black woman named █████, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century.
SarahBrown	training	Speilberg	█████████'s direction is all over this picture, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances.
SarahBrown	training	Alice Walker	While it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the African story, both of which were so vivid in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, allowing the voice of ████████████ to shine through.
SarahBrown	training	Jerome Kern's	Despite █████████████ collaboration with the film, his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), yet the songs serve the film well.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly's	"The dancing is nothing short of excellent, especially coming from ████████████ solo number and my favorite musical number, ""Alter-Ego Dance."""
SarahBrown	training	Rita	And ████ plays a sweet, charming girl here; a role that's a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941).
SarahBrown	training	Cole Porter	Yet the film's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters, Irving Berlin or ███████████, wrote the songs for this film.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████ still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	 But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept ████'s desire.
SarahBrown	training	Coen	Shot on a shoestring budget, yet had the flavor of the early ████ brother's film Blood Simple ... and throw in some Monty Python flavorings to boot!
SarahBrown	training	Ricky Gervais	Another encounter involves the brilliant █████████████ as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.
SarahBrown	training	Matthew Vaughn	"Not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director ██████████████'s (""Layer Cake"") effort deserves an audience."
SarahBrown	training	Jamie Foxx	I had no expectations; I'd never heard of ██████████; all I knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it.
SarahBrown	training	Marius Goring	The supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in Technicolour - this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor (a fantastic █████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Richard Benjamin	████████████████ appears as Matthau's nephew, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality.
SarahBrown	training	P.J. Soles	"I liked this movie I remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where Riff Randell (played by ██████████) is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the Ramones are in the room with her sing the song ""I Want You Around"" ...very very cool stuff."
SarahBrown	training	Poonam	When Prem meets ██████ for the first time, they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way Prem and Poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen.
SarahBrown	training	Poonam	What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and ██████, how they fall for each other is too sweet.
SarahBrown	training	Prem	Scenes which touched me was when ████ takes Poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet.
SarahBrown	training	Mary Ellen	Well anyway you have ██████████ Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance.
SarahBrown	training	Joan Collins	Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured ████████████, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!
SarahBrown	training	Richard Chamberlain	"A corporate lawyer (███████████████████) is dragged into a case involving ""city"" Aborigines, and this is no ordinary case."
SarahBrown	training	Chamberlain	███████████ is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what's happening, although no matter how many times I've seen this I can't quite grasp the exact connection.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir's	This is a very eerie and creepy film, and is a fine example of ████████████ ability to create tension out of nothing.
SarahBrown	training	Brosnan	"A well formulated story and film all together, ███████ has never been better in a film role outside of his ""Bond"" movies."
SarahBrown	training	Davis	"█████ in one of her best roles since ""American Splendor"" gives another charming and witty performance."
SarahBrown	training	Willy	The scene when they meet again in █████'s flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection.
SarahBrown	training	Walter Matthau	██████████████ gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can, the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization.
SarahBrown	training	George Burns	████████████ timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film, his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable.
SarahBrown	training	Cousteau	This was amazingly filmed with real animals; how ████████ got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable.
SarahBrown	training	Walther Mathau	question: how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers ██████████████ in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode?
SarahBrown	training	Lando Calrissian	They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of Endor while ████████████████ leads the attack on the Death Star.
SarahBrown	training	John Williams	It's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic Acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by █████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Jean Eustache	For direction, cineaste █████████████ drew from the simplicity of early-century cinema; for story, Eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life.
SarahBrown	training	Jodie Foster	"████████████, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like ""a family"" (like the family unit she's never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't."
SarahBrown	training	Baio	"Or an even longer sequence--also with ████--where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the ""pain of illusion""."
SarahBrown	training	Christopher Walken	██████████████████ is very catlike, and doesn't need stupid make-up, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human.
SarahBrown	training	Powell	██████ and Pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions.
SarahBrown	training	Roger Livesey	 All of the performances are spot on (█████████████ being a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, never has there been a more romantic film than this (if there has I haven't seen it).
SarahBrown	training	Sang-hyeon	"We see the conflicts of both of the characters- ██████████ being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and ""idiot"" brother, the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama."
SarahBrown	training	Sang	There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (████, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.
SarahBrown	training	Oldboy	Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor, much like ██████, only here with a bite (pun intended) meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being.
SarahBrown	training	Bunuelian	What makes Thirst last in the mind is how elements come together, of drama and existential pains, of a █████████-surreal sense of Catholicism (I especially loved the dynamic between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood-sucking but really wants to be a vampire too), and of the erotic: the scenes where the priest finally gives in to Tae-Joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets.
SarahBrown	training	Thrist	But ██████ is an excellent addition to his oeuvre, and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general.
SarahBrown	training	Phillip	I can really identify with Busy ███████'s character, and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	It deals with his stress of trying to perform a ███████████ each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young, able bodied ones being taken for military service.
SarahBrown	training	Shakespeare	I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama, theater--especially ███████████, or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity.
SarahBrown	training	Calamity Jane	█████████████ is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home.
SarahBrown	training	Vladimir Nabokov	The scenario is based on the novel by ████████████████ and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant.
SarahBrown	training	Turturro	████████ definitely gives his best performance to date proving he's worth much more than what we thought.
SarahBrown	training	Turturro	The story is about a phenomenal chess player (████████) which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Bogdanovich	'They All Laughed' is a superb █████████████████ that is finally getting the recognition it deserves, and why?
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Cassel	When they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult, but, when the first applicant is ex-con Paul (██████████████) she seizes the chance to change her life.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	█████ covers his mistakes and he, anxious to go straight, reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagues.
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard's	"French filmmaker █████████████████ third feature ""Read My Lips"" is a genre-defying piece, switching from dark social comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller."
SarahBrown	training	Bert Scranton	Her working buddy is █████████████ (Cliff Edwards) and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob.
SarahBrown	training	Ned Kelly	In Australia and especially country Victoria the name █████████ can be said and immediately recognised.
SarahBrown	training	Greta	In █████ he is still a Hero, the life Blood of the Town of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there.
SarahBrown	training	Ned	It is not self justification it is ███'s biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting.
SarahBrown	training	Paul Ryan	█████████, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast.
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	██████ was among the students in the home room where nine students have died, supposedly killed by her boyfriend.
SarahBrown	training	Alicia	██████, we realize, is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life, but we are not given any clues to that effect.
SarahBrown	training	Deanna	Since she doesn't cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see ██████ in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows.
SarahBrown	training	Ryan	The film has an intensity because it's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred, which helps the tone that Mr. ████ wanted to give this movie.
SarahBrown	training	William Haines	The film shows that ██████████████ had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him, learns his lesson, and then redeems himself by winning the football game, the polo game, etc.
SarahBrown	training	Pepper	General ██████ has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress.
SarahBrown	training	Billy	Eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and █████ part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles.
SarahBrown	training	Eve	Adam was not so responsible for Eve's but this Adam(priest), sacrificial and responsible to pick ███ up from the Paradise Lost, vampire's world.
SarahBrown	training	Goodrich	"An ultra-nervous old man, ""Mr. ████████,"" terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing, really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it, saying ""You will be next!"""
SarahBrown	training	Goodrich	"The moment poor Mr. ████████ hangs up the phone and says, ""I feel safer already,"" a monster-type goon named ""Nico"" appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious."
SarahBrown	training	Jane Fonda	I have every reason to dislike ██████████ for her Vietnam era actions, but personal feelings apart, she is fabulous in this role.
SarahBrown	training	Robert DeNiro	█████████████ is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities.
SarahBrown	training	DeNiro	This is the first I have seen ██████ using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Shepard	 Writer and director ███████████████ did the Q&A after this delightful movie at the Austin Film Festival.
SarahBrown	training	Joan	Young rich ████ and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies - and now they have to work for a living!
SarahBrown	training	Joan	In the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for ████ to do a couple of risque dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam-shovel).
SarahBrown	training	Joan	████ looks great, and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity (thank God she stopped the dancing!).
SarahBrown	training	Harry Beaumont	And there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director ██████████████, who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience!
SarahBrown	training	Randell	Riff ███████ is a wildly, obsessed fan of the rock group; The Ramones and so are most of the students in the school.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	But a new tyrant of a principal, Ms. █████ thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students, especially the music from The Ramones.
SarahBrown	training	Joe Ramone	But Riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer ██████████ and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	Especially in the scenes involving Ms. █████ with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set.
SarahBrown	training	Togar	The enthusiastic acting is pretty campy, but that goes down well with the material and there's a certain likability stemming from these characters, but we totally despise Ms. █████ and her hall monitor goons.
SarahBrown	training	bush	There's no beating around the ████ here when I say 'Rock 'n' Roll High School' is an intoxicating hoot, of a rad time!
SarahBrown	training	John Williams	The production quality, cast, premise, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) locale and lush █████████████ score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item.
SarahBrown	training	Schmidt	"This genre has been more successfully handled by ""Nobody's Fool"" in the mid 90s and this year's (2003) ""About ███████."""
SarahBrown	training	Smith	This is sort of a Mr. █████ goes to Washington type of movie, with some variations but the same premise.
SarahBrown	training	Emily Watson	Similarly, ████████████ shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage).
SarahBrown	training	Turturro	To reach the tortured chess master (████████) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love.
SarahBrown	training	Watson	██████ does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring.
SarahBrown	training	Luzhin	"Later, as their love affair develops, she subtly likens dancing to chess (██████ has learnt to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with ""bold, brilliant moves"" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover)."
SarahBrown	training	Danny	█████, the quintessential nice guy, is dealing with some stuff in his own life and, truth be told, could use a friend as well.
SarahBrown	training	gore	First of all, the killing and ████ is implied but never really shown in any detail, meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you.
SarahBrown	training	Matador	And second, unlike most anti-hero films, ███████ makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character.
SarahBrown	training	Julian	If you read about someone like ██████ in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer, but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity.
SarahBrown	training	James Bond	He doesn't completely divorce himself from his ██████████ good looks and smooth charm, but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix.
SarahBrown	training	Michael Bay	I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything ███████████ has came up with.
SarahBrown	training	Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx	Story: ████████████████████████) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson).
SarahBrown	training	Pat Boone	It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by █████████ is still played on the radio.
SarahBrown	training	La Maman et	███████████ la Putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects.
SarahBrown	training	Françoise Lebrun	The very long monologue spoken by ████████████████ is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood, manhood and love.
SarahBrown	training	Alice Cooper	First and foremost, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by such artists as ████████████ and the Velvet Underground in addition to the infectious non-stop assortment of Ramones songs.
SarahBrown	training	Allan Arkush	The energy level is high, with co-story author and director ████████████ bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings.
SarahBrown	training	Rob Bottin	There are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects notable ██████████, in one of his earliest gigs.
SarahBrown	training	Donner	By this time around, the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and, happily to say, with this film ██████ not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	He tells the story with precision and an eye to detail, and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative, especially █████.
SarahBrown	training	Scott	There is such a purity and honesty in his Scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen █████ do it; simply put, he IS Scrooge.
SarahBrown	training	George C. Scott	And forever after, whenever you think of Scrooge, the image your mind will conjure up will be that of ███████████████.
SarahBrown	training	Peggy Pepper	What gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, ████████████, whose acting is the talk of Savannah trying to make it on the big screen.
SarahBrown	training	Davies	"Many stars of the silent era have cameos in ""Show People,"" including ██████ herself without the curly hair and makeup."
SarahBrown	training	William Haines	It's a shame ██████████████ quit the movies - he was cute and energetic, deservedly an enormous star back in the day.
SarahBrown	training	Hickok	Even if might not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important about ██████ and about the time it takes place.
SarahBrown	training	Anthony Quinn	█████████████ has a very short appearance, that already shows what a great actor he was going to become.
SarahBrown	training	Rusty	But, naturally, that's not what █████ ultimately wants, because, as usual in films of that time, the right guy is the only thing on the girl's mind.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	█████ does the first of his amazing trick dances, this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	The melodrama gets a bit thick, and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two, but █████ takes this film to the next level.
SarahBrown	training	Peter Weir	Writer/Director ██████████ manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' two years earlier, that you will continue to remember years later.
SarahBrown	training	Burton	As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the Dreamtime, the truth exists on two completely different levels, with ramifications more disastrous than ██████ could ever have imagined.
SarahBrown	training	Weir	On the production side, ████ uses his budget to great effect, progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting, to heavy rain, to good use of sound.
SarahBrown	training	Richard Chamberlain	███████████████████ manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery.
SarahBrown	training	David Gulpilil	██████████████ excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds, wanting to do the right thing, but afraid because he already knows the ending.
SarahBrown	training	David Weir	Put all these things together, and you have a perfect example of why ██████████ is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on.
SarahBrown	training	George Lucas	"Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, ████████████ gives us a rousing finish of the ""Star Wars"" saga in ""Jedi""."
SarahBrown	training	Darth Vader	███████████, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it's construction.
SarahBrown	training	Luke Skywalker	The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring young ██████████████ to the Dark Side.
SarahBrown	training	Lando	While █████ heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star's shield generator on the Forest Moon Of Endor.
SarahBrown	training	Luke	During the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as ████ willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side.
SarahBrown	training	Valentine	Yet again unlike Urban Legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes █████████ the best.
SarahBrown	training	Katherine Heigl	███████████████ is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables.
SarahBrown	training	Denise Richards	███████████████ is killed third, while she just found a Valentines' Day gift for her at a whirlpool bath.
SarahBrown	training	Jessica Capshaw	███████████████ is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer.
SarahBrown	training	Marley Shelton	██████████████ is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know, 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed.
SarahBrown	training	Dorothy	The third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene, the Valentines' Day celebration at ███████'s house scenes and ultimately the killing themes.
SarahBrown	training	Majin	The Yokai Monsters series is not the equal of █████ at its best, but the Yokai are nevertheless great fun.
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard's	The food was quickly forgotten as I became engrossed by director and co-writer █████████████████ original and superb thriller.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Worse and humiliatingly, she accedes to a girlfriend's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in █████'s bed.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	As █████ and Paul get to know each other better, the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Ingenious Paul recognizes that █████'s ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be.
SarahBrown	training	Pat Boone	█████████ behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because, unlike thoroughbred jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers.
SarahBrown	training	Pat Boone's	(Disappointing though that ███████████ religious/moral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl!
SarahBrown	training	Walter Brennan	Home in Indiana with ██████████████ (filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song) captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying
SarahBrown	training	Boris	War breaks out, and without much hesitation █████ signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty.
SarahBrown	training	Veronica	He cannot even say good-bye to ████████, for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away.
SarahBrown	training	Mark	His brother ████, a vigorous musician, who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption, is eager to take his place.
SarahBrown	training	Veronica	████████ initially resists, but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms.
SarahBrown	training	Boris	In her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers, until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers, for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of █████' death.
SarahBrown	training	Gene Kelly	The dancing, of course, is top-notch, since ██████████ had more than just a hand in the choreography.
SarahBrown	training	Kelly	The number is hardly five minutes long, but it (and █████'s genius) still takes one's breath away, even sixty years down the line.
SarahBrown	training	Rita Hayworth	You can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto COVER GIRL and █████████████--not that she doesn't deserve it.
SarahBrown	training	Jonathan Speelman	Despite the use of █████████████████ as consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move.
SarahBrown	training	Josie Lawrence	I only watched this because it starred ██████████████, who I knew from Whose Line is it Anyway?, the wacky British improvisational comedy show.
SarahBrown	training	Jacques Audiard's	Running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive French production, █████████████████ gritty crime caper, Sur mes levres ( Read My Lips ).
SarahBrown	training	Carla	In a Paris construction firm █████, a shy, diminutive young woman sits at her desk, sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Obnoxious coworkers use the front of █████'s desk to chat and drop off their half-finished Styrofoam cups of coffee.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Partially deaf, █████ turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome, be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend's baby.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	When her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load, █████ fears she may lose her job.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	At the employment office █████ lists the specifications she wants for her assistant (preferably male) as if she were at a Personals Agency.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	When the agency sends over an unkempt , menacing looking young man, █████ is both shocked and intrigued.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	They leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery, where █████ interviews her prospective assistant.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	When she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison , █████ initially wants nothing to do with Paul, but has a change of heart and hires him on.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	Although she is basically kind toward her helper, █████ now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power.
SarahBrown	training	Carla	The screenplay borrows elements from Hitchcock, most notably REAR WINDOW, where █████'s lip-reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars.
SarahBrown	training	Hitchcock	That being said, what one carries away from this movie isn't so much the similarities to classic █████████ thrillers, although those elements are definitely there, but the pervasive view a of a modern day city (in this case Paris) where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy, garish nightlife where sex, drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters.
SarahBrown	training	Coleen Camp	I thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches, the cast (especially ███████████) is perfect and the Big Bad Apple never looked better on film.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce Broson	█████████████ is amazing in his role as a hit man, who suddenly becomes burned out & asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for help.
SarahBrown	training	Pierce	The imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially at the bullfight scene & when ██████ sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs.
SarahBrown	training	Castro	"Sunday July 16, 8:00pm The ██████, San Francisco ""As a Southern colonel your make-up is very Indiana"" The yammering gossips of Hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in Marion Davies direction over the years."
SarahBrown	training	Billy	"What she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball, but a job is a job and █████ convinces her "" . ."
SarahBrown	training	Vidor	█████ throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot (and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder, facing the camera!)
SarahBrown	training	Billy	█████ runs into the High Art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming, with predictably nutty results.
SarahBrown	training	Irving Thalberg	While it's true Show People is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence, it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from MGM, ███████████████, and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent.
SarahBrown	training	Vincent Price's	Had I never seen ███████████████ version of HOUSE OF WAX, I probably would have liked THE MAD MAGICIAN a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9.
SarahBrown	training	Jodie Foster	This is one of the best ████████████ movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public's misconception of it as a teen flick.
SarahBrown	training	Jodie	The three girls that play █████'s friends are somewhat amateurish but I do think it is worth seeing.
SarahBrown	training	Bartlett	There's no story to speak of, but ████████ uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology.
SarahBrown	training	Fleischer	"PERHAPS in an attempt to find another ""Hot Property"" for adaptation, the Brothers █████████ thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the Newspaper Comic Strip with their production of 1933's POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer Studios/Paramount)."
SarahBrown	training	brawlin	AS is now common knowledge, the gruff, squinty eyed, ███████' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever; outlasting and literally outliving the Fleischers and their Studio, lasting to this day.
SarahBrown	training	HENRY	█████ was a most popular feature in the Hearst Papers' line-up; appearing as both a Daily and on Sunday's Color Comics Supplement, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY.
SarahBrown	training	Betty	IN viewing the chubby, little, bald boy Comic Strip 'Hero' and his on screen antics, both solo and in tandem with Miss █████; we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled.
SarahBrown	training	the HENRY Feature	These mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page; as █████████████████ was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime'.
SarahBrown	training	Dave Fleischer's	THE FUNNIEST LIVING American (Fleischer Studios/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what is; basically being a one situational exercise; being punctuated with the usual array of ████████████████ rapid fire, machine gun-like gags.
SarahBrown	training	Henry	It is a sort of love at first sight as █████ attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had, to coins in his pocket.
SarahBrown	training	Betty	BUT a reprieve is soon on the horizon as █████ asks the boy to mind the store, while she leaves on urgent business.
SarahBrown	training	Henry	GETTING to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the Fleischer Crew to fire up a whole new string of gags; this time featuring bird seed, █████'s bald pate and push brooms.
SarahBrown	training	Henry	█████'s enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds; out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break.
SarahBrown	training	Henry	BETTY returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with █████'s temporary custodial care.
SarahBrown	training	Betty	We have the carefree, energy filled, free wheeling of the boy, the kindness of █████ and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation.
